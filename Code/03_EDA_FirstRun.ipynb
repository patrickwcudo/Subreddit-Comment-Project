With Damian Lillard returning to the lineup the Raptors really don’t have the guard play to handle Lillard, McCollum, Powell, and Covington. To add to that Nurkic is also returning to the lineup. Revenge game for Powell for trading him so I see this as a statement game for the Blazers to want to rally around that energy.

It also prevents you from having to worry about over-exposure to your core because you should only be playing one lineup. With cash though I would lean towards projections rather than gut because with such condensed ownership you can’t really afford to get away from chalk when some guys are clearly much more optimal than others each slate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do about 80% cash 20% gpp every slate so I still have room to experiment with some contrarian plays and hedge my core a bit.\n",
      "I view all the different sites as good starting points but don't take everything they say as religion. The guys on one of the biggest DFS sites were constantly saying not to play TJ McConnell even though the guy was returning value almost every night for a couple of weeks. They were very big on both SGA and Tony Bradley yesterday and didn't say anything about Nickeil Alexander-Walker even though he's been playing more minutes lately and was in a good matchup. I went ahead and played him in a handful of lineups and was thankful I did. But I also played too much Bradley and suffered because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's always going to be some randomness, which is why the person at the top of the GPPs every night usually has someone who was 5% or less owned. I won a small tournament on DK last week by playing 4 guys who were under 10%. You're definitely right about letting the recommendations get in your head and swaying you from players that are still viable.\n",
      "I looked at Theis too. I saw how the coach used him the game before and was iffy on his minutes. I don't like Theis tonight as much as I like Williams.\n",
      "Funny you mentioned MLB .. started looking into it as nba season ends.  It definitely feels hit or miss like NHL but without all the correlation —- perhaps how PGA seems to me.  A whole new adventure!\n",
      "I should've gone theis over Poku. Same minutes security, same price, and theis is less owned and safer.\n",
      "Sounds like your original approach should work well for MLB DFS.\n",
      "Yup I definitely will read a couple quick articles but the ownership usually tells you things like Moses popping.. then it’s adjusting the mix to taste.  Tonight’s a great example of where lately I’d hone in on Houston game or  Sacramento game  but so many more options to leverage for gpp.  just going to be more careful with low salary chalk.  1-2 vs 3-4 guys\n",
      "Sometimes the content is right though. Moses Brown was good chalk and I wasn't thinking about him the night before when I started looking at pricing. Usually OKC goes with Roby but this guy was 3.5k and put up 50+ points. Yes please!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight a bunch of Houston guys should pop. Porter Jr without Wall and Oladipo, sign me up. I have a hard time believing that Wood is going to play, and if he does, how much is he going to play, so I'll avoid him. I will probably go back to Martin Jr at PF because he should get minutes in garbage time, so should Porter Jr. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Rotogrinders I believe Court IQ is still free. You can remove all the injured/traded players and it'll show you how many minutes they've played without those guys on the court, how much their production goes up, what their usage is like and useful info like that. For example, if you Remove Bam off, Jimmy Buckets goes to like 1.58 points a minute. And if you look further you can see he get something like a .19 fantasy boost per minute (I think that's what the bottom section is for). It's not foolproof but it sure helpful.\n",

      "\n",
      "I knew the risks going in, but, he's playing minutes and minutes = points (in theory). He also only shot 2-9 so the volume was there and if he was making his shot, say, like 7-9, he would have got somewhere in the 20's pointwise. I can live with that although it's not great.\n",

      "I use Rotogrinders and for me it does help. I really get rid of the players I don't want it makes the lineup optomizer pretty good. I use the opto as a guide because I build most of my lineups by hand. The opto will show me where a lot of people are going to go so I could pivot from some of those guys, and sometimes it shows me a guy I wasn't even thinking of.\n",
      "I don't think you understand how the optimizer works. It is a tool, like a calculator. You have to make a strategy then 'program' the tool to do what you want. I use it and I am doing very well this year.\n",

That was a run on sentence I don’t feel like editing, point being, cash is not easy and if you’re a casual player just playing a few cheap games each night, enter the single entry tournaments or 3-5 entry max tournaments and call it a night.

I haven't taken down a GPP just yet, but I've come in 2nd a couple of times which have been nice paydays. It's also been a lot of work since the NBA changes lineups, rotations, etc. more than any other sport. It can be exhausting and really frustrating.

      "One way to do it: Scroll to the bottom of cash game contests and if a guy's lineup just looks downright awful (and didn't tank due to injuries or unforeseen blowouts), send him a H2H match.

Steph Curry will torch the hell out of Kanter but Rubio wouldn't have the same success as Curry cause Rubio lacks a respectable jumpshot. Kanter knows to back off and his teammates are telling him the same.\n",
      "I guess I wasn't referring to DvP specifically, I don't look at it either. My point was more that matchups can matter especially with center where you can target certain teams because of their poor defensive bigmen, usually in pay up spots. It's not solely pace and usage\n",
      "It's all dependent on skill though. Vucevic vs Kanter, give me that. Gobert vs Kanter ummm I might pass on that depending on the price of Gobert. Tristan Thompson vs Kanter, no advantage gained as both play close to the rim.\n",

      "Yep same. Sucks that’s this is how dfs works. Play the chalk, they bust. Fade the chalk, they go off. The optimal strategy is probably to alway fade the chalk, but fomo and continuing losing in hopes of the one big win is not fun.\n",
      "Yeah, but it can matter. Center ownership always draws towards the matchup, which often has to do with pace but can also be because of the opposing big man. Centers going against Kanter will see a bigger ownership boost in a matchup with Portland relative to the what their teammates might get from the pace up spot.\n",
      "Nah same goes for centers. Centers don't play in the post as much and they also don't know how to really defend in the post. You also have to take into consideration that there are different types of centers with different skill sets.\n",

There are a ton of other possible scenarios, like they get out to a lead on the back of their big man, or Miami keeps it close and they need Wright to step up in order to win. Ultra specific scenarios like that can be helpful, but realistically games are unlikely to happen exactly as we envision them. That could very well happen, but I wouldn't count on it.\n",

      "Did you ever try playing the same line up in the $1 and the $5? To see what the difference would be? I also feel the same way. Every time I play in a higher $$ I lose so bad. But I only play for entertainment.\n",
      "The only time I won big ($3300) was when I went very risky on a showdown slate.  I played the $33, $50 and $12 single entry.  It's likely just coincidence.  Especially if you're talking NBA.  I've gone weeks where I am cashing 5 out of 7 days.  Since that big win, about 2 months ago I have been in the biggest slump ever.  I am still way up on my winnings, but that's only because of that win.\n",

      "Yes in terms of a high ticket. Lower cost lobbies are filled with people who fill out 150 lineups. But I've been in a few lobbies that I used a ticket with that would cost 100. At most you might see a few people betting maybe like a 1000 dollars in that lobby. So there odds drop drastically.\n",

I basically just play $3 and lower contests unless theres a ticket or some mission with dumb rewards.  I usually break even on DFS, and take advantage of DKs desperate attempts to get people to use sportsbook\n",

      "I always hear it's the opposite, that higher dollar games are actually easier to win.\n",
      "I hear this very much\n",
      "I have similar luck. I have decided that it’s because I get scared when more money is on the table and play safe. When it’s a low stake contest, I take big shots that pay off on occasion.\n",
      "Do you know how much money the threshold is?\n",
      "I think, unless I’m remembering wrong, if you have won enough to be excluded from the &lt;$5 contests, they can still play in it if the total prize pool is &gt;$20k or something like that. But generally the contests under $5 should be slightly easier, but it’s not by much. At least in the $5-$10 range, I can’t speak for high stakes, I’m sure those are pretty tough. I personally stick to the $3 3 entry max gpps on DK. I definitely don’t play in anything that’s 150 max, unless I get a ticket or something. And that has nothing to do with who else is in the field, I’m just not going to enter anything close to 150 lineups.\n",
      "Happens to me but I just think it’s coincidence.\n",

Keep in mind that the average defensive rating of the teams Toronto has faced in that span is 110.4, while Portland's is 116.8. Theoretically, if Toronto played those games against the Blazers' defense, their average 1H point total would be 120.6. For what it's worth, using this same formula the Blazers' 1H total would be 121.66. For the sake of simplicity I'm averaging this out and rounding down to 121.

      "**Last Pick Analysis:** Actual game line is CHI+3.5. DECENT RISK - BE CAREFUL as always. I like it until CHI -5.5. The Spurs are looking to break their 4G L-streak here, while the Bulls are looking to get back at the Spurs for the 4Q beating they took in their previous matchup. CHI was leading by as much as 20 points, only to lose late in the 4Q. CHI got rid of WCJ and the veteran Otto, but got Vooch in return. Today will be Vooch's first game, and he'll definitely be looking to shine, playing alongside Lavine. Poeltl isn't a match for Vooch, so the Spurs will definitely need to send double teams every now and then in the low post, forcing Vooch to kickout to the nearest shooter. I think the Bulls dynamic will change here, probably averaging more 3pt attempts than usual (usually 30 attempts - looking at around 39ish) because of Vooch's arrival. Expecting White, Lauri and Lavine to all have higher 3pt makes due to better looks. Also important to note that (in a 10 game sample size), CHI is ranked 7th in backcourt defensive efficiency, and 2nd in 3pt defensive efficiency (backcourt too). Another point I like is that the maestro Thad Young will likely lead the 2nd unit with White, and though White isn't great, I consider it decent firepower against the very thin SAS bench. My only worry is Vooch's slow &amp; lackluster defense might be exploited by Coach Pop. However, I'm still expecting CHI to completely dominate this game, and win 126-111 (Higher than their usual scoring).\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Last Pick Afterthoughts:** OK FOUR 5U LOSSES IN A ROW THIS IS FRUSTRATING. Bulls took a lot of 3s, BUT NEVER HIT THEM. THEY SHOT 8 of 34 3s. How horrendous. Entire team played like how we expected, getting good looks beyond the arc, but just not hitting them. That is just sad. Young seems slightly lost in his new role, and the entire team just gave up so many TOs in the first half alone. They finally picked up and started catching up in the 4Q, but it was already too late. Way too difficult to overcome a 36pt lead in the 3Q. Vooch played with 0 heart. His offense is really good, but man,  does he have the defensive IQ of a rock or what. Coach Pop really did exploit this by running double cutters and backscreened runners into Vooch and just confusing him like a lost guppy. Plus the man just plays with zero heart. I hate that. SAS won 120-104. Apologies boys.\n",

      "&gt;!Analysis: Actual game line is TOR-1.5. BIG RISK - BE CAREFUL as always. I like it until TOR -8.5. I'm going with TOR again here. Putting my faith in statistics above emotion. TOR lost big for us in a 5u b2b, but this time I feel they're back. TOR has exceptional 3pt backcourt defensive efficiency, currently 6th in the league (recent 10 game sample size), while POR is ranked 2nd from the bottom. For frontcourt, POR ranks last in the league in 3pt defensive efficiency (same 10 game sample size). TOR loves to put up 3s almost as much as UTA does, and should have a sizeable lead because of this. TOR is also first in the league in team forced TOs when OG is playing, vs POR's bottom 10th ranking. Expecting the main TOR squad to go wild here, hopefully shooting lights out from beyond the arc. Also looking for a big game from Gary Trent Jr against his former team, with 6+ 3s. Norm will be norm, but I'm expecting OG to be his usual disruptive self, and contain POR overall. OG is pretty much the key to TOR winning in any given night. Siakam has also been playing angry in the past few, trying to prove a point to Coach Nick Nurse, and I'm expecting him to be the same All Star in this one. Expecting around 20 of 47 attempts to drop from beyond the arc for TOR here. Hopefully Dame Time is flustered tonight. Looking at TOR to win here 127-114. I really don't want to go under 50u profit here. We NEED this win Raps!!!!&lt;\n",

      "Don’t look now but Mick Cronin has UCLA playing some fantastic basketball right now. A team that was plagued by inconsistency throughout the season has reeled off 3 straight as an 11 seed. They had wins over Michigan State and BYU which on paper looked like good wins. However, I think both teams were overrated and BYU could not buy a 3 in that game. Their win over Abilene Christian really isn’t anything to write home about either. This will be their first real test of the tournament and it comes against an Alabama team under one of the best coaches in the country. The Crimson Tide just Rolled right over the Maryland Terps, a very good defensive team, and hit 16 three pointers on the way to a 19 point victory. A big thing here is that guard Joshua Primo was back from injury and looked healthy. They were missing him in the Iona game and it showed. This is a team that can run almost any team in the country out of the gym on any given night. UCLA is 212th in the country at defending the 3 and that is really going to hurt them in this matchup. On the flip side Bama is one of the better defenses UCLA has faced all season and this game just doesn’t feel like it will be close. I’ll take Bama with the points and I think they probably win by double digits here. \n",

The Bruins are a whole lot stronger from the line than they showed against Abilene Christian.\n",

Both teams also have defended the 3-point line well. The Crimson Tide's opponents are 15 of 50 (30 percent) in those two games, and the Bruins' opponents are 13 of 51 (25.5 percent). Alabama is 11-1 SU in the last 12 games, but 6-6 ATS in those. UCLA was shaky before bracket, but since then they are 3-0 ATS in bracket games, all wins with a significant advantage of points.\n",

As I mentioned, I would bet on Alabama before the bracket, but the recent games of both teams show quite different trends.

On the other hand, Liquid is looking really sharp, especially individually. I feel like they are currently a step ahead of EG in every way. I recommend betting on **Liquid ML @ 1.70 3u (MEDIUM)**\n",

Khachanov is an agressive baseliner that will try to win easy points off his serve while Sinner is more of a counterpuncher with an all around game. Sinner reminds me of Andy Murray 2010-2012 with a steady game. As you can see from the previous scores, they were very close and could have gone either way.

      "- Michigan allows way too many three-point shot attempts. That's fine for your average three-point shooting team, but FSU is 15th in the nation at 3P%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- FSU on the other hand *does not* allow very many three-point shot attempts; their defense is designed to funnel more to the inside... where they *swat your shit* at the 11th best rate in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Michigan sucks at getting breakaway steals. FSU is really good at getting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Little midget Mike Smith (5'11\") is running the point for Michigan. That's cute but he's going to be absolutely *bodied* by MJ Walker (6'5\") from FSU.\n",
      "\n",
      "- FSU swallows up offensive boards. Gray, Koprivica, and Barnes really fight for good position and they actually box mf'ers out.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Michigan defense simply does not force enough turnovers to stop this FSU offense. Michigan allows opponents to get off too many shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "- FSU likes to drive and/or pound it inside and get off close shots. This is their highest offensive tendency. Michigan sucks against teams that pound it inside. Look at Illinois on March 2nd. They lost by 23. Illinois pounds it inside too. Look at Michigan's game about a week ago against Texas Southern. Of course they won, it was a -25 spread, but they under-performed (didn't cover by 9 points) against a terrible team that prefers inside shots too.\n",
      "\n",
      "- FSU 3-point defense has been elite. Look at their past 3: Colorado went 6/25, UNCG went 7/27, Georgia Tech went 5/23. Michigan had to go 10/25 from deep to beat LSU, and that is not happening here. When Michigan shot closer to 30%, they lost most recently to Ohio State. As mentioned before, FSU doesn't give great 3-point looks anyway.\n",

I have dabbled in years passed, but this year I wanted to try and be more serious about it.  Getting into the 150 entry tournaments is just not my thing.  Cash games and single entry is where I live now.  AND, to stay on topic, it's largely because of the optimizer.  I can't seem to get it to work the way I want.\n",

Yeah, it's fun to play for the $100K, but your chalkier stuff is going to be far more likely to turn a profit chasing the $1-2K prizes in SE. If you can't afford to throw 150 into the Clutch Shot - or just don't want to go through the effort of making 150 lineups - then I would stay away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to disagree with the comment above that said \"If you are always 1 or 2 points away, then you are actually a much better player than most\". It may, or may not, be true, but remember that most players are losers over time and being better than most is *probably* just means you are losing at a slower pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your lineups are consistently hovering around the min cash line then you need to take a look at your roster construction (or contest selection). Fact is, the payout for minimum cash is only 1.5-2X and even if you feel like you're hitting it consistently there's a strong likelihood that over time you won't get there often enough to turn a profit over the course of the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want play the big GPPs, I don't think you can be happy with a minimum cash. Sure, it's better than a loss, but if you're constructing your lineups with that in mind then you're never going to produce one that finishes at the top. For GPPs you need to study the top lineups each night and start your own construction with an aim to finish in the top 3% or so - and even that's only 2.5X in the FanDuel Clutch Shot - and to understand that this means you're going to have lineups finishing in the bottom 3% just as often as at the top. These contests are SO top heavy in payout structure that the only way to finish in the black over time is going to be to hit one or more top 50 finishes over the course of a season...and a \"safe\" lineup rarely does that.\n",

If you've been playing long enough and learned enough about the game of DFS, you'll learn how to assume a player/team's ownership in your head because of the matchup, pricing, range of outcomes. You're going to tell me you can guess which players I'm going to choose from if we went H2H? In the milli-maker,  Yes, ownership absolutely matters because the odds of somebody already building that combination of players are far greater than the odds of only 1 of 100 entries building that same combination. \n",

That's about where I'm at, and I've been consistently making $25-40k per year off of DK the last few years. But I'm also bad at saving money(never had any before I got good at DFS.)

I think Carton is a good play, Cain is overpriced, Garcia is a fine play but you’re taking on more risk with him, John is an okay play, and I wish we could play Mcewan at that nice price, but unfortunately I don’t think his minutes are guaranteed.\n",

The super speedways (Daytona/Talladega) are typically less laps and its spread out in terms of who leads laps and fastest laps, plus there is usually a huge wreck which shakes things up. The road courses are longer tracks with less laps, again meaning that laps led/fastest lap points aren't as important.  \n",

Just to give you an idea, you get 1 point for a Par, 3 Points for a Birdie and 5 points for an Eagle, while losing nothing for Bogeys of any kind.  They would NOT allow me to pick all LESS than 24.5.  I had already deposited the funds.  I contacted them.  They did NOT give me an answer as to why I was not allowed to pick all LESS.  I also played a 2 player contest, in which I tried to go LESS on both.  Once again, I was not allowed.  They already had my money.  So, I gave in, and had to pick players to go MORE.  I was in contact with them throughout the day.  I deposited $450.  I lost $250 on College Basketball, and $100 on each Golf Match.  I should have won $2200 and $300.

      "Going back to a spread bet for today’s pick. Alabama looked like a legit Final Four team in their last game and we’ve seen that they can muscle out a win when their shots aren’t falling and DOMINATE a win when they are. I think UCLA’s hot streak comes to an end against this tough Alabama team. The Tide has won 11 of their last 12, play great defense, and have many guys who can kill you from deep. Alabama has covered 4 of the last 5 times they were given a single-digit spread. UCLA hasn’t seen a team like Alabama in this tournament yet, so I’m big on the Crimson Tide.\n",

Both teams are coming off of wins, but it feels like Denver has something to prove and will use this as a statement game. I also dislike Trae Young and his stupid lollipop that fell on the floor ass hair for no real reason.

My point is LeBron is a PG, but he also has SF eligibility. if we're going off the \"kyrie said harden is a PG\" then that would make kyrie a SG and not a PG. but here he is, as both. it seems like DK is just forcing your hand and not using that same rules with all players/positions. if harden is PG only, then kyrie should be SG only and so on\n",

Started paying a little monthly for some data and projections, built my own optimizers, and my own algorithms. I was still only throwing down maybe $10-$20 per night across maybe three or 4 contests. Still wasn’t winning much. Read about how these big guys spread their risk and decided to try it. Been putting down about $100/night across multiple contests with a number of different lineups. So far, I’ve been profitable. Not greatly profitable and not every night but the nights I lose it’s not typically the full $100 and the nights I win I usually hit one in the top 3 and make $100 or so. \n",

But one piece of advice I was given last night was to air on the side of rostering more late game plays, because it will give you more lineup flexibility to make changes when lineups and inactives are announced. This can let you get smash plays (like Lou Will after Kawaii was ruled out) at low ownership, since other lineups are too locked in by then. If Kawaii was inactive before slate top off I bet Lou Will would’ve hit 50% ownership, but instead you got him for under 10%.\n",

      "2. I've said it before, but DFS isn't a sports game, it's a data analytics game. Eventually the analytics become good enough to beat the game and I think we're there with the NBA. You're not going to win NBA DFS as a basketball fan, that's just the way it is. There's too much information out there and it's gotten to the point that it's good enough that DFS quite simply isn't a \"game\" anymore. Take away everything I said in the first point and force everyone to hand build their lineups on their own. The sharks are still going to be duplicating each other and if you're not duplicating them? Sorry, but you're the fish.\n",

      "I'm not even sure the first one can be addressed with any teeth. As long as the information exists, someone is going to sell it.

As that edge approaches nil, those that have \"solved\" it out are certainly smart enough to figure out that there's more profit in selling to the fish than trying to beat the other sharks.\n",

My primary sport is hockey and earlier this situation Pete DeBoer said he wouldn't be announcing starting goaltenders, if you want to know who's starting tune in when they take the ice. Super aggravating from a DFS perspective, makes Vegas goaltenders near unplayable but in no way, shape, or form should he be thinking about me when it comes to his lineup.

      "1. Expected minutes: this is the most critical element to nba dfs imo. Whether you’re trying to find value plays or your top pay up option, having and understanding of the minutes someone will play is critical. This season especially with so many players missing games there’s a ton of value to be found when a team is only running 8-9 guys for a game. With the spend up options it factors more into game script - a guy like giannis isn’t going to pay off his price if the game blows out. Knowing whose injured each slate and determine where those minutes will be allocated is crucial. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Matchup and pace: I’ve been targeting teams playing the nets, bulls, wizards and timberwolves all year. Teams that play at a faster pace and have higher scoring games are going to result in more fantasy points. Knowing teams that have exploitable matchups will be huge in finding smash plays (big men against Minnesota w/o KAT, nets for example). \n",
      "\n",
      "3: Correlation: this comes most into play for me when I’m picking my spend-up options. If I’m playing a superstar at a 10k+ price point I’m going to be hoping the game stays close so that they finish out the game and get big 4th quarter minutes. In order for this to happen, a player or players on the other team are going to need to have good nights so I’ll look to play the opponent as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "4: Fantasy points per minute: this is a bit of a redundant point since I’ve already gone over minutes, but for value plays especially it’s important to know what guys are good ppm players relative to others. Gary Clark or pj tucker might be in line for huge minutes thanks to injuries or Covid but if they’re only getting half a point a minute it’s not going to pay off. But if someone like Boucher, Cousins, or Whiteside is in line for more minutes you can feel confident that they’re in a good spot to smash because they’re so productive fantasy wise. \n",
      "\n",
      "5: Ownership: this is an extremely important piece as well. If you’re playing tournaments, you almost have to find low owned players that go off in order to achieve a good placement. Guys who are coming off injury (porzingis, valanciunas recent examples), in shooting slumps, or maybe a bit overpriced are good places to look. In cash, knowing the chalk is also very important. In basketball especially players are usually chalk for a reason, and it generally makes less sense to fade them in cash. Make calculated decisions as to whether or not to play the chalk and avoid the hero plays in cash. \n",

      "Putting it all together: \n",

      "Here’s the gpp lineup I ran last night that cashed in the second-to-min tier. \n",

      "Curry, Ross, Oubre, Draymond, Vucevic, Maxey, Olynyk, Derrick Jones Jr. \n",

      "I chose to stack the magic warriors game because both these teams had a lot of injuries that opened up value, but ultimately missed on my fill-in guys. Maxey seemed high-upside without Milton and I expected Derrick Jones to play bigger minutes than he did. Still cashed because my stack paid off and the lineup was so highly correlated, but a little higher owned than I would’ve liked.\n",

      "Those are actually pretty good takes. I would throw in Ian Heinisch to as a dog to beat KG. He's been on a skid but he has been training a more well-rounded game so I expect him to clinch up KG and land some TDs and point himself to a victory.

      "\n",
      "Biggest piece of advice is to pay attention throughout the day and close to lock for each game. Know that you're putting out a lineup that is going to be active and don't fall victim to a failed COVID test or \"load management\" decision made 20 minutes before tip.\n",

      "The more I dive into Rotogrinders, the more I like it. There's so much info on that website. I have no clue how to apply it all, but I'm digging it. I use RG mostly, twitter A LOT, awesomo sometimes, and then google search everything else for stats, etc. That usually answers any questions I might have.\n",
      "I just started playing NBA DFS this year and absolutely love it. It's such a grind, but so much fun. I feel like anyone you ask or talk to or read about has their own system per se. For me, I tend to look at minutes, points per game, history, match up and opportunity for that player. I also use projections on various sites (RotoGrinders, Awesomo, etc.) and see if my own personal projections match theirs. One thing I learned early on was that if you consider a player a massive value, then everyone else does too and they tend to be the highest owned players on the slate which is great for cash games, but not great for tournaments. As far optimizer's go, they're only as good as the work you put into, so if you pay for one, pick 2 players and have it spit out 150 lineups, then you're probably not going to do very well. You have to do your research on the front end before you understand how to work them. Like I said, it's a grind, but once you find your mojo, you're off to the races. I'm still so new to it all and definitely not cashing every single night, but I'm learning more and more as I play and know the big takedown is coming soon. Good luck with it!\n",
      "I’ve been playing for almost 10 years now and have about a half dozen single entry wins over multiple sports the last few years.  While I do not have any huge wins (I don’t play multi entry tournaments 99.9% of the time any more) I’ve been profitable for at least the last 3 years.  It takes A LOT of practice and good game selection to be good at DFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basketball, despite being my favorite sport generally, is my worst DFS sport.  I do best at baseball, MMA and NFL (in that order) and have recently started playing NHL despite not watching hockey at all.  I did this because the rule set in NHL is similar to that of baseball.\n",
      "\n",
      "But anyway, here are a few tips.  Please remember that I play almost exclusively single entry tournaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Read the rules: this might sound silly, but really, take 5 minutes and read the actual rules.  Some sports like baseball, hockey or football have one scoring play that is worth multiple times more than everything else.  In those cases it’s the homerun, goal or touchdown.  I lean heavily into people who do these things regularly.  The draw back is a feast or famine approach that will leave me out of the money more often than I would like, but the upside is that one good night will pay for your whole season.  I win a baseball tournament once because I had 6 guys hit homers.  I won a football tournament once because I had 7 guys from the same game and it ended up like 45-42.  Don’t be afraid to throw all your eggs in one basket.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- all things being equal choose your least expensive players first.  You don’t want to start out going “tonight I’m using Patrick Mahomes no matter what” and then you need to backfill your roster with sub optimal plays to fit that initial thought.  If you choose the least expensive player you would be willing to use first then you’ll know exactly how much room you’ll need to fit in a star.\n",
      "\n",
      "- download every lineup update app you can find.  When baseball season comes you’ll be happy you did when a pop up rain shower is scheduled to roll in 37 minutes after first pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "- forget what happened yesterday.  Just because a player was good yesterday doesn’t mean he will be good today.  Also, just because he was good yesterday doesn’t mean he won’t be good again today.  Every slate is a new game.  Treat it as such.\n",
      "\n",
      "- in specific sports this is what I look for most ...\n",
      "\n",
      "MMA: the ability to end fights quickly\n",
      "NFL: the ability to score TDs\n",
      "NBA: hell if I know that shit’s impossible \n",
      "NHL: the ability to score goals\n",
      "MLB: the ability to hit homeruns\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this helps.  At the end of the day there is no magic sauce so just read the rules and do your best to maximize what those rules allow you to do.\n",
      "This is why I only play GPP.  I'm not trying to build bank roll.  I'm trying to make the slates more interesting and enjoy low risk / high reward lottery tickets.\n",
      "Don't forget -- if you mostly play cash, but usually throw in a low entry fee GPP for each cash lineup just in case it blows up, then the one time you don't you'll finish 8th in a 10,000 player pool 50/50.\n",
      "If you don't mind hearing from someone that at best doubles in a GPP and in most cases misses the money, I research what people post in this thread and the articles linked herein.  So, not sure who also using those is winning big, but it ins't me.  There are a few things I'm really good at doing.  I'm really good at picking healthy players on days I make sure to check before first tip off, but also really good at finding someone that somehow doesn't play on days I forget to check back before first tip off.  Lesson:  Check back before first tip off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also pretty much only play single entry, low entry fee GPPs on FD.  Strategies I look to use, which I don't know whether they work include maybe staying away from high costs all stars on the back of a back to back if they had high minutes the day before.  I just feel their ceiling game is less likely, and that's a high cost to have to get 5-6x, which is usually like 45-65 fps.  I'll look for value plays of guys that may be filling in for a resting starter, but more times that not, there are a few of these guys any given slate, and thus far I've either missed the right one, or the right one is chalk and I hit it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, probably my worst strategy, is to for some reason be attracted to guys with the orange envelope next to their name, meaning some recent news.  If I click those dudes and their recent points seem way too high for their price, I choose them, and they usually suck.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, maybe this is a lesson in what not to do.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:  Don't play the guys the websites say to play.  Don't play guys with orange envelopes next to their name.  And don't play guys that are filling in for resting starters that seem like a good value.  Your best bet is to nail the studs so they produce 7x, and then pick a few random dudes that absolutely go off for no reason other than people that play a ton of line ups have them, and get lucky.  Good luck!\n",
      "You shouldn't write those websites off just like that. Imo consuming as much content as possible around the industry is the best way to really get a good feel for each slate. You need to know how the field is approaching a slate in order to approach it correctly yourself. The large majority of the time they are very good players who give good advice.\n",
      "Yea I am new to this as well, I thought that you would only pay taxes on what you cashed out...but could def be wrong.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm looking into that. I'm just confused on one particular thing. When I get the 1099-MISC form from Draftkings, I copy the info from it onto my 1040 tax return form in the proper section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that step, the only notable one would be any deductions? Because I'm failing to see what else I have to provide other than reporting the winnings from the form and whatever else info on it onto my 1040.\n",
      "A tax professional may be able to save you a lot of tax money. DFS isn't exactly gambling or a hobby. Its kind of a grey area.\n",

      "That wasn't wrong. He just got hurt.\n",
      "Every month changes tiers\n",
      "It’s $2 and a few hundred crowns total.\n",
      "Lost all my money lol\n",
      "You’re trying way too hard for that achievement. Is it really worth it to be throwing money away now for the chance of getting a few bucks later? Just let it happen naturally, you never know. One day there could be an injury and a 3K guy is thrust into the starting lineup and he scores 50+. You wouldn’t have had him because you were going for the achievement, but because you’re a good DFS player who pays attention to news. But yeah you are totally wasting your time and money going for that achievement.\n",
      "I got both that one and the rookie phenom one the same night. Don't remember who hit either. But my advice to you is to not try and get them. Just let them happen organically. And if they don't, then oh well.\n",

      "Especially with all the games missed for rona. There will be plenty of chances without trying for it.\n",
      "I mean, Simms has the better matchup. That Clemson interior D is no joke. And well the entire Clemson D is elite. But Wright is a star. I prefer Simms but it wouldn’t surprise me if Wright went off. It’s just that we saw him struggle against UVA, a similarly tough matchup, Clemson might be tougher than UVA. Just something to keep in mind. But yeah this is a tough slate, I have to rely strictly on stats when normally I rely on stats and the eye test, because I’m very familiar with almost all the significant power 5 players. A lot of these players I don’t know too well. I should provably pay closer attention to the mid majors. 🤷‍♀️\n",
      "I did it this year with Alexander-Walker for the Pels when they had a ton of guys out and no other guards on the roster. I think alot of people got it then as well because NAW was chalk on that slate. \n",

I feel better about Jacquez than Campbell, but you could make an argument for either one. The top 3 for Oregon are all really good plays, I just trust the usage from Eugene and will Richardson over LJ. But LJ is still a phenomenal play. Christopher and Bagley are just both appropriately priced. There’s not much to talk about there. But they should be good plays, I’m rostering Christopher in two out of five lineups. I might swap Bagley into one of them. Noah Williams is fine, I just don’t want too much of that game, and I prefer the players I mentioned on the UCLA side.

However doing this adjustment on the front end when calculating DvP may conflate (1) strength of schedule and (2) any baked in salary adjustments already done by DraftKings. May be worth getting a clean projection then comparing against the salary DK or FD is offering.

      "My first season playing NFL DFS. My biggest win was $3.9K in week 4 showdown; the second-biggest was $1199 in week 16 main slate. More losses than wins in between. Chasing that big week 4 win was my downfall. Learned a lot from this reddit forum. Thanks everyone!\n",

      "1. The optimizer you use in the attached datasheet was created using Excel solver. That felt like a simple and accessible way to provide it to other users. As for our projections, there are (literally) hundreds of thousands of data points that go into them. We create our baseline points projections by projecting player minutes and multiplying that by player points per minute historically. (Generally PPM is calculated from the past 15 days, but there are certain cases where if say, Durant is out, and the sample size is big enough, we look at his teammates points per minute in the past when Durant has been out, obviously, sample size oftentimes becomes an issue there).\n",
      "\n",
      "From our baseline points projection we make adjustments based on dozens of matchup and recency based factors, if I had to pinpoint the main 5 they would be player profile defense vs position (see [here](https://analyticcity.com/pages/player-profiles-an-advanced-analytical-approach-to-dfs-matchups)), salary adjusted DvP (especially if sample size for player profile is too small), O/U, TM Usage out, POS Usage/Min's out, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Currently, I have been collecting data from this season for which I can backtest my adjustments against, seeing if adjustments I make reduces the error created from our projections and the actual player points. I would love to test this against last season as well, but I have had a hard time finding the full sets of data I need, and going back to every single day manually seems infeasible. As for informal evaluation metrics, the optimal lineup generated by our model has outperformed the min cash line in 50-50 contests it has entered 57% of nights on DraftKings and 59% on Fanduel!\n",

Oregon goes crazy from the 3, making 47.6% but USC isn't too far behind, as they shoot 47.1%. The main thing to watch is the pace, Oregon LOVES scoring in transition but USC is an absolute beast on the boards. Oregon was BUILT to play Iowa, especially with Iowa's best player being Garza, who is a beast but slow as molasses. \n",
      "\n",
      "I personally think USC is Oregon's kryptonite and their last time playing each other a bit more than a month ago (when USC won by 14 points) is indicative of how this game will go. A week off means that momentum doesn't really factor in as much and true talent/matchup shines. If USC can dominate down low like Garza on offense, but keep a fast pace on defense/cut off transition points (which Garza and Iowa did NOT do)  I can see them winning by 10.\n",

      "**Reasoning:** Both teams suffered defeats last week, however at stages both teams looked solid. Any game in Perth isnt easy, however with Fremantle having a few outs due to injury i think this helps a slightly stronger giants team. This game should be a relatively low scoring game, whereby Giants will find it slightly easier to come by goals in which will give them a 2-3 goal edge at the end of the game. Expect both teams to put up a valiant effort but a stronger bounce back game from Giants is needed here, to have any hopes of challenging for a finals spot.\n",

My favorite part about it though is being able to customize and build a lineup around specific players that I really feel are going to do well on a certain night.\n",

On FD since positions are locked, total projected ownership for PG, SG, SF, PF would be 200% each, and C is 100%. Maybe there's a way to normalize the numbers to hit those targets for FD or something\n",

We're pretty confident in our projections, but getting accurate historical data on ownership for free has been tough. Thanks for the feedback!\n",

Those companies are obviously great and should be your go to if you're willing to shell out 25-50 bucks a month, but for those of us who prefer to play only a few times a week, or lower stakes, AC has a lot of the same features (and even some stuff they don't!)\n",

MMA DFS is similar to other sports where you usually have the most success throwing in a bunch of different cash and GPP lineups.

      "\n",
      "I also believe Gilbert Burns is worth a play in a few lineups as he poses a serious threat to Usman on the feet and especially on the ground with his BJJ skills.  I don't feel comfortable rostering Usman because even though he is extremely talented, and rightfully so a big favorite, his style does not score many points as he often does nothing with his takedowns and just stalls and holds his opponents against the cage.  I expect his salary to be way to high for his style of fighting.\n",

A lot of ways for him to matter; TB is trailing and needs to throw deep for a TD, one of TB WRs gets injured, he gets 1 catch for 10 yards and you need that value cause all the studs went off. Is it likely? Probably not, but if you play in the milly maker contest, its a 600,000 people contest, to win you need a .000001 lineup (1/600,000).\n",

      "You make some valid points, I still think Ayo is one of the best plays on the slate. Bottom line is he is too cheap and I’m not too worried about matchup if he’s playing anyone other than Baylor. Watts could be a potential value play, but he’s too risky for my liking. His minutes aren’t guaranteed and he’s been playing terrible since the start of the season. Micah potters minutes dipped pretty significantly in the last game which makes me kind of skeptical. Aleem Ford is basically the same price and he played 32 minutes in the last game. Of course potter could go off on any given slate, and I’m very aware Everyone’s minutes on Wisconsin are very erratic. So it could be potter that gets the boost in minutes and Ford gets the dip, even though Ford played great last game. But I agree at least that Murray’s recent uptick in minutes is very promising. But ultimately, you really don’t have to play Ayo; there are plenty of other guys to at up for. In my opinion, Ayo is the best price adjusted play, and I’m gonna stick to that. Even if he duds and scores like 25. But I really doubt he will. Thanks for the feedback! Even if I don’t 100% agree, I appreciate any feedback and anyone challenging my picks and giving alternative plays.\n",

      "Micah Potter, pretty cheap and great value. I don’t actually know the stats on PSU’s defense, but I can’t imagine harrar guarding Potter effectively.

      "Imagine entering a $10.6K entry 3-player contest on Fanduel, shortly after you enter Player X joins. Five minutes later Player Y enters. After awhile you notice that Players X and Y seem to join these contests within minutes of each other. More than that their lineups *never* match (contests of this size and at this price point *routinely* chop). Players X and Y are likely colluding by ensuring that their lineups *do not* match, giving them a 2/3 chance at winning the contests and splitting the proceeds. This is the kind of collusion that takes place (there are two top players on FD who are fairly well-known to do exactly this), but there's simply no way that top players are doing this at price points below $500 or so, they're not doing it in a 22 person contest, and their not intentionally matching lineups.\n",

I'm a winning player. Not by a huge margin but I am. Its the fact that you can see that regardless of what people are saying that a couple of the top usernames in the game along with another handful of usernames are closely linked together and are making plays in direct coordination with eachother. Peoples answer that they must be using a public optimizer is shit. So why isn't everyone else using that optimizer have the same lineups all the time? Why is it only these certain usernames that end up with the same lineup on slates as big as ten games even? How can anyone with a straight face say that these top guys who play for tens of thousands a night and win more then anyone must just be using some paid site and that's how they get their picks.

      "Yeah it seems like a lot of the sports do. I figure they get easier because people arent willing to take huge risks with bigger entry fees. And a lot of times those huge risks are what wins contests\n",
      "Baseball contests get easier when above $5.  It’s the only sport I regularly play above $25.\n",
      "Makes sense. I am definitely going to take some shots this year. I usually try to stick to single entry 1 or 2 dollar tournaments. Usually play everything on DK but I like that Fanduel only does one pitcher so might switch back over for MLB\n",
      "I do stack for sure but the stacks come naturally.  Like if I thought the Phillies 2 and 4 hitters were gonna crush I might throw in Harper batting 3rd even in a bad match up.  A lot of times you get the most value out of all star hitters by throwing them in against sub par matchups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is how I do it.  Please note that I specialize in single entry tournaments and ideally smaller slates.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 - find a pitcher who is expected to win and strike people out.  There is no such thing as too expensive.  Sometimes this is a cheap player, sometimes it’s not.  On DK you need to find 2.  While I’m pro DK in every other sport I prefer FD for baseball because of one pitcher.  Anyway, get this right.  Nothing else matters if you screw this up.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - Usually I start by finding the lowest priced player (often an outfielder) who I believe can hit a homer.  Many days this is a bench player in a platoon.  A homer at 2500 gets as many points as one from a 5500 player.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - Work backwards finding the cheapest potential homer at each position.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 - With whatever you have left upgrade to superstars.  I might not project Tatis for a homer that day but I’ll take my chances over a bench player in a spot start.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, work backwards.  Superstar hitters last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, keep in mind that a homer from a Yankee at 33% owned probably costs more than one from a Royal at 2% owned.  There is a legit big market bias in DFS baseball ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit - 3 years ago the standard baseball advice was not to stack.  Now everyone does.  In many ways stacking in baseball has jumped the shark bit.  Totally viable but probably done a bit more than it should be these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "However ... one important note is that while you’ll never see an NBA game double the projected over under you’ll see it almost daily in baseball.  You have to find the game that goes off the rails for it to work in baseball.  A few years ago I had 6 homers from 4 to White Sox so it can work, but it worked more before 2020.\n",
      "Definitely makes sense. I think I am going to try out your strategy this season with baseball and see if I can make a little bit from it. Having that homer or nothing strat is good but definitely super hard for some positions. Do you team stack or anything? Or just look for the homers\n",

HAVE TO be exact same roster , with the exact same depth chart and settings or else its pointless. Again, it' s real general but if i watch 20 sims between Arizona and TB and 17 out of those 20 sims Christian Kirk leads Zona in receptions and yards, a more than likely td's .  Well, i'm gonna play Kirk instead of Hopkins . The same can be said for RB's and other WR's .

I also enjoyed the \"core\" lineup screen shots.  I think that helps people visually see how to start and triggers then to start thinking of how to feel in the rest.  The only play that I really think is incorrect is Kyrie over Durant.  Kyrie is fine for cash but has not exploded for any GPP ceiling, he is that consistent 45-55 DKPs but has no change of that 70 burger.  Durant just had a 77 DKP game and he is more expensive but I think he is the better play.

On a \"normal\" night, I'd make 60-70% of what I put in on a max Showdown - the only way you profit is from hitting top 10 every once in a while, which is really hard without multiple entries (and multiples lose you more money). \n",

      "It's even worse with the big GPPs with full lineups; you often end up having far less than 50% hit money and those hitting the bottom end of the bubble, making you under 50% back. And it's way harder to get top 10 due to more people playing. \n",

Of course, a 2 game sample size is nothing, but if the trend were to hold then he has a point. But having played both for a while... I don’t think the trend will hold.\n",

      "They would have to be using the exact same tuned optimizer and colluding their lineups. Even with the same data for the thing to spit it out in the same order identical like that for 8 people its not possible.\n",
      "In a ten game slate you guys literally don't understand statistics to use the same players with the same utility same everything in the same order over 8 different people. How impossible that is. Learn math\n",
      "Yeah it does, if the projection is the highest median and they're using the same/similar data. Why would you intentionally choose a non-optimal lineup if the goal is just to finish top half?\n",
      "I did score more. I was in 1st. Doesnt mean it's not wrong and collusion.\n",
      "Yes so 8 of the highest rated players in DFS like Papa gates and Chipotle just grabbing a top rated lineup in a optimizer tuned exactly the same as all the other top guys. Makes sense LMAO\n",
      "No it doesn't. Did you read any of the responses in the top response on the post? The exact point of the optimizers is to find the lineups with high median scores, and many people will grab the top rated one from the list of efficient ones.\n",
      "are you doing a youtube stream tonight?\n",
      "Yes both chipotle and papa gates them were part of the 7 or 8 identical lineups. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any for anyone saying they prob just were the top projected guys, bullshit. In a ten game slate to have the same lineup with the players in the exact same order and in the exact same utility spots is not possible. They prob accidently didn't load in their 8 different but similar lineups and ended up with the same lineup on accident that all but proves they are colluding\n",
      "Double ups or cash lineups should consist of the most popular and guaranteed usage/score lineups . So it's not uncommon in cash lineups at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus would have it mattered if you scored more then they did ?\n",
      "Well,..the advantage is..you are taking up entry spots, so lessening the chance someone will beat you honestly.....\n",
      "They'll enter any and all guaranteed contests that they possibly can. However, if someone has $1 million career earnings on DK they're not allowed to enter contests under $5 unless the total prize pool exceeds $25k, I believe.\n",
      "Probably has found over time that expected returns are better entering 1000 $5 contests than 10 $500 contests. If it’s all done through a piece of software, not really a difference in terms of effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or he’s entering at such volume that he’s literally filled all other contests above $5 lol.\n",
      "i had chipotleaddict in a $5 double up the other day... i was like wtf doesnt this guy have bigger shit to chase?\n",
      "Yea...who ya gonna complain to, these people don't even take telephone calls!!!\n",
      "thanks :) glad your doing well!\n",
      "If someone is saving all the games' .csv files for a whole month for a bigger sample size, then investigating for collusion, etc, then that'd be more compelling proof.\n",
      "Ahh okay I see. you are not giving yourself enough credit. The last couple times I used your sheets most of your players bold and/or italicized hit value.\n",
      "prob hurts them both some, dejounte more than demar\n",
      "Derrick White activated, but will likely have limited minutes if he plays at all. Wondering how much Dejounte or DeMar suffers from his activation?\n",
      "And the people who do this like PapaGates and ChipotleAddict spend so much money on the site, DraftKings has all the more reason to look away.\n",
      "Bingo. There is zero advantage gained by multi-entering cash games. You're competing against yourself at that point. As an extreme example, why stop at just 8/22 lineups? Why not use multiple accounts to enter 22/22? The answer *should be* obvious. One lineup is optimal. Anything above that is -EV.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the frustration with paid optimizers. Sadly I do not see any way to regulate that. You can be an honest player and build your own projections, but you'll just end up with close to the same numbers anyway if you're doing it right. Best to either join the club or avoid cash games altogether.\n",
      "There is collusion and was proven when one of those Bachelor/Bachelorette couples was caught a few years ago.  And yes, Rotogrinders,  Awesomo, DFS Army players are all using the same Optimizers. But, as said in a previous reply,  they don't care because they want the rake.\n",
      "Why don’t you bold or italicize players anymore?\n",
      "Yeah im with you on this. Not much reason to use multiple accounts in cash games, you could just play more H2H/Double up lineups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could even be people getting lineups from the same source, but I'd guess in cash it's just the top projected players.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other point, you'd never want to use multiple cash lineups for the same slate. Literally just eating into your own upside at that point.\n",
      "That last sentence is all that matters. As long as people keep forking out money hand over fist, they will not make any changes. Money is the loudest and most effective negotiator.\n",
      "Nah, not collusion. Just 8 people using similar projections, if not the same projections from a paid source, to come to the same optimal lineup.\n",
      "[deleted]\n",
      "It is definitely good to have a healthy amount of suspicion when playing on these websites.  There are many examples of this happening in the past and it is definitely possible that there is collusion.  I’m not sure if support will give the you an honest answer if they found collusion because they get a piece of the rake.\n",

      "Tampa is gonna need 30+ to even have a shot of winning. Gonna be tough to get there with a bunch of FGs. Also, I'm a KC fan. Darrell has been so consistent in the playoffs.

      "As always the question is: What's that extra $1.4K allowing you to plug into your lineup and maybe that makes the difference for you. Obviously, kicker range of outcomes tend to be a bit more narrow than skill players but, for me, this doesn't look like it'll shape up to be the type of game where a kicker is going to help you all that much.

      "Nice job and nice cash lineup. Just my two cents here, but I think you're limiting your upside by entering a cash lineup into GPPs. More often than not a cash lineup is gonna end up a little short of the cash line for GPPs. But if you keep a core from your cash line and sub in some lower owned pivots, you have a better shot at a bigger payday. Of course its higher risk, but thats the point of playing gpps. Sticking to your 80-20 bankroll management is key and still allows you to be profitable over time.\n",

      "\n",
      "UCLA is just a solid team across the board. They are 15th in offensive efficiency, scoring 113 points in every 100 possessions. They are 66th in defensive efficiency, allowing only 94 pts in every 100 possessions. UCLA is also 13th in the nation at 3p%, shooting 38.9%, as well as 19th in FG%, shooting 48%. They are just an efficient and well run team. They face a very tough test in Alabama this weekend as they are one of the best teams in the tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see here, there aren’t many advantages for either side. Any advantage that Alabama has, UCLA pretty much matches or is slightly behind them. There are two that stick out: Consistency and Pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "UCLA is one of the more consistent teams in the tournament. They are methodical and you always know what you’ll get from them- efficiency. Alabama, on the other hand, is erratic but talented as hell. You never know which Alabama team you will get - the one who’s going to kill you, or the weird one with the tail between its legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pace is the other major difference here. This is a battle between the tortoise and the heir. UCLA being the tortoise (337th in pace) and Alabama being the heir (19th in pace). This is actually an advantage for UCLA, in my opinion, as if they’re able to slow Alabama to their pace it will make Bama uncomfortable and cause them to make more mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some fun stats:\n",
      "\n",
      "* When facing teams that have an offensive near-proximity FG% less than 63.5%, UCLA performs better than the norm 64% of the time. Alabama’s near-proximity FG% is 58%.\n",
      "* When facing teams that have a second-chance potential point rate greater than 12.6, UCLA is more efficient than normal 50% of the time. Alabama has a second-chance potential point rate or 17.34.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "This should be a close game at the end. Ultimately, I think Alabama squeaks out a win, but UCLA will put up a fight. I also would not be surprised if they outright win the game. All we need is UCLA to not lose by more than 6 points and I think that happens here.\n",

      "**Fooxied’s Breakdown:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of my friendly cappers and also the public money is on the side of Alabama and even before the bracket, I would also bet on them, but recent games have shown their weaknesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since beating Michigan State in the First Four, the Bruins have been on a roll and one of the main reasons is the play of great guard Johnny Juzang, who is averaging 22.3 ppg in the last 3 games. The Bruin defense was fantastic against the ACU shooters in the 67-47 win, the team was excellent from the start offensively and the rebounding has been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alabama shoots a whole lot of threes, but UCLA has been okay against the Pac-12 teams. It’s a better shooting team from the outside and it’s going to roll on the free throw line. The Tide limited the fouls in the 96-77 win over Maryland, but it’s usually putting teams on the line at least ten times and UCLA should pounce. The Bruins are a whole lot stronger from the line than they showed against Abilene Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both teams have shot the ball well from 3-point range in the tournament. UCLA is 24 of 56 (42.9 percent) in three games. Alabama is 21 of 47 (44.7%) in two games. Both teams also have defended the 3-point line well. The Crimson Tide's opponents are 15 of 50 (30 percent) in those two games, and the Bruins' opponents are 13 of 51 (25.5 percent). Alabama is 11-1 SU in the last 12 games, but 6-6 ATS in those. UCLA was shaky before bracket, but since then they are 3-0 ATS in bracket games, all wins with a significant advantage of points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underdogs are doing extremely well in the tournament, most games are really close. As I mentioned, I would bet on Alabama before the bracket, but the recent games of both teams show quite different trends. I didn't think UCLA would make it that far, I don't think they can win this game, but the spread Vegas is offering us has some good value. I think it should be closer to 4.5 which is why I think UCLA is a good choice here.\n",

      "\n",
      "Competition: League of Ireland First Division\n",
      "\n",
      "Bray Wanderers competed in the First Division last year, the second highest tier of Irish soccer, and came a single point shy of automatic promotion. They had the best defensive record in the league, conceding 13 goals in a truncated due to Covid season. When playing at home, they conceded 3 in 9 games.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, they're not the favourites to win promotion due to the quality of the teams relegated from the Premier Division last season, ie Cork City and Shelbourne. However, Bray are a legitimate First Division side, with pedigree in the competition and should certainly be considered the 'best of the rest', with the only real competition for third place coming in the form of Galway United.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treaty United were granted a license to compete in the league 5 weeks ago: https://www.the42.ie/treaty-united-42-read-5383097-Mar2021/.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's how long they've had to train, how long the team has had to gel and how much work they've been able to do. No superstars have arrived, not even a player who really catches the eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "They've competed in 3 friendlies in preseason, drawing 2 and winning a third. You may be thinking this isn't too bad of a record, however the first of the draws came against Premier division side Waterford (who are tipped to be relegated and are in a similar disarray with a messy transfer window and poor signings). \n",
      "\n",
      "The second draw, and 2-1 win came against an Athlone town (First Division) side who did even look to be trying. Athlone were lethargic on the ball, didn't even seem to want it back when they were out of possession, yet the best chances given to and taken by Treaty were given to them on a plate by an Athlone side that would've rather not showed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "To top it off, towards the end of the second Athlone game the fitness levels of the Treaty players was exposed. All the goals came in the first half and the last 20-30 minutes of the game looked more of a walking kick about than a preseason preparation match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bray Wanderers to beat Treaty United: expect Treaty to fly out the box early and put pressure on, but have faith in a fitter, more professional and defensively sound Bray team to absorb it, turn the tide and cruise to victory.\n",

Khachanov is an agressive baseliner that will try to win easy points off his serve while Sinner is more of a counterpuncher with an all around game. Sinner reminds me of Andy Murray 2010-2012 with a steady game. As you can see from the previous scores, they were very close and could have gone either way. Even if someone wins 7-6, 6-4, the bet would cash. Expect at least 1 tie breaker.\n",

      "Great point u/Analytic_City. You can also adjust for salary by using DraftKings points per $100 to find good value players. However doing this adjustment on the front end when calculating DvP may conflate (1) strength of schedule and (2) any baked in salary adjustments already done by DraftKings. May be worth getting a clean projection then comparing against the salary DK or FD is offering. If you’re interesting in playing around, would love to send you a beta code for [Pine](https://www.pine-sports.com).\n",
      "Great stuff, really interesting visuals too. One thing I would mention though is that DvP is a **very** flawed metric. It fails to account for the quality of opponent these teams have faced! (you can read about that more in depth [here](https://analyticcity.com/pages/salary-adjusted-dvp-the-new-standard-for-dfs-opponent-matchups)). For example, what if the Jazz have just played worse point guards then Denver? Then point totals aren't really relevant. You can fix this by adjusting DvP for player's salaries (which I discuss in the article).\n",

      "1. The optimizer you use in the attached datasheet was created using Excel solver. That felt like a simple and accessible way to provide it to other users. As for our projections, there are (literally) hundreds of thousands of data points that go into them. We create our baseline points projections by projecting player minutes and multiplying that by player points per minute historically. (Generally PPM is calculated from the past 15 days, but there are certain cases where if say, Durant is out, and the sample size is big enough, we look at his teammates points per minute in the past when Durant has been out, obviously, sample size oftentimes becomes an issue there).\n",
      "\n",
      "From our baseline points projection we make adjustments based on dozens of matchup and recency based factors, if I had to pinpoint the main 5 they would be player profile defense vs position (see [here](https://analyticcity.com/pages/player-profiles-an-advanced-analytical-approach-to-dfs-matchups)), salary adjusted DvP (especially if sample size for player profile is too small), O/U, TM Usage out, POS Usage/Min's out, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Currently, I have been collecting data from this season for which I can backtest my adjustments against, seeing if adjustments I make reduces the error created from our projections and the actual player points. I would love to test this against last season as well, but I have had a hard time finding the full sets of data I need, and going back to every single day manually seems infeasible. As for informal evaluation metrics, the optimal lineup generated by our model has outperformed the min cash line in 50-50 contests it has entered 57% of nights on DraftKings and 59% on Fanduel!\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Currently there are two of us! I am the \"data guy\", so I handle all the spreadsheets, graphics, data analysis, and the other one of us writes the blogs you will find on our homepage!\n",

      "Our Match-Up Tool consists of a chart with how many FPPG on average the team is giving up to each position. It's similar to our NFL Match-Up tool that you might be used to. It's sortable by position and shows the Opponent, spread, and O/U. What we will do down below is show you the Top 5 plays on today's slate per the match-up tool. These are the only plays we like though. Make sure to check out the article with some projections up above. Good luck and let us know if you like this!\n",
