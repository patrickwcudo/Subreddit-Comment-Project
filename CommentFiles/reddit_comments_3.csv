Last 3 picks:

Pelicans -6 (1u) W

Nuggets ML (1u) L

76ers -4.5 (1u) W

**Pick: USC -2 (1.5u)** vs Oregon 3/28/21 9:45 PM ET


Sport: NCAAM


Reasoning: Took a little break from posting and ofc I go 3-0 during that time lmfao. Alright, easy dub here with USC. Oregon when they make 8+ 3s are 15-1 on the season, that's great. Oregon goes crazy from the 3, making 47.6% but USC isn't too far behind, as they shoot 47.1%. The main thing to watch is the pace, Oregon LOVES scoring in transition but USC is an absolute beast on the boards. Oregon was BUILT to play Iowa, especially with Iowa's best player being Garza, who is a beast but slow as molasses. 

I personally think USC is Oregon's kryptonite and their last time playing each other a bit more than a month ago (when USC won by 14 points) is indicative of how this game will go. A week off means that momentum doesn't really factor in as much and true talent/matchup shines. If USC can dominate down low like Garza on offense, but keep a fast pace on defense/cut off transition points (which Garza and Iowa did NOT do)  I can see them winning by 10.",,1616899084,The58683Shoe03582Man,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

53,sportsbook,"**Record: 6-1-0 (+6.02U)**

**Last Pick:** St Kilda Saints 1-39 (Margin) @ 2.50 **L** \- Tough first loss, as we looked good to begin but lost any competitiveness on the verge of half time.

**Todays Match**: Fremantle Dockers v Greater Western Sydney Giants - **AFL**\- 5:40pm ACDT (6 hours til start)

**Pick: Greater Western Sydney Giants 1-39 (Margin) @ 2.50**

**\*For People who cant find this pick, either take Giants ML or on the line (this will be lower odds but essentially same pick)\***

\*also to clarify, 1-39 means the Giants to win the game between 1 and 39 points\*

**Reasoning:** Both teams suffered defeats last week, however at stages both teams looked solid. Any game in Perth isnt easy, however with Fremantle having a few outs due to injury i think this helps a slightly stronger giants team. This game should be a relatively low scoring game, whereby Giants will find it slightly easier to come by goals in which will give them a 2-3 goal edge at the end of the game. Expect both teams to put up a valiant effort but a stronger bounce back game from Giants is needed here, to have any hopes of challenging for a finals spot.

I don‚Äôt like the Champagnie pick, simply because 1. think he‚Äôs overpriced and there‚Äôs plenty in the 7-8 grand that I like and could easily perform just as well. And 2. Since there‚Äôs not a whole lot of ‚Äústar power‚Äù, champagnie will be heavily rostered in lineups.

MMA DFS is similar to other sports where you usually have the most success throwing in a bunch of different cash and GPP lineups.

58,dfsports,"I play on Fanduel so the scoring is different, but so far:

I like Ricky Simon because he is a takedown machine and Kelleher struggles against upper level fighters.  

Rodolfo Viera is an undefeated BJJ ace with all of his wins coming via stoppage and he is facing a young inexperienced fighter.  

I wouldn't feel comfortable with Gastelum based on his last 2 performances, even though he is clearly the superior fighter to Heinisch

I actually like both Barber and Jimmie Rivera in contrast to Grasso and Munhoz, but both of those fights could go either way.  

Julian Marquez could be worth a shot in a few lineups, as Pitolo has looked terrible against any stiff competition that he has faced.  I hate MMA math but Marquez also put Phil Hawes to sleep who is a legitimate top prospect in the MW division.

I also believe Gilbert Burns is worth a play in a few lineups as he poses a serious threat to Usman on the feet and especially on the ground with his BJJ skills.  I don't feel comfortable rostering Usman because even though he is extremely talented, and rightfully so a big favorite, his style does not score many points as he often does nothing with his takedowns and just stalls and holds his opponents against the cage.  I expect his salary to be way to high for his style of fighting.",,1612827838,TheRealJoeLunardi,mma_213_dk_lineup_help

so I invite you to witness the birth of a new subreddit by a degenerate, currently 16 hours old

www.reddit.com/r/gamblingstocks

Not my original dd or write up, i converted and launched the new subreddit here hours ago!

initial dd link here: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld8dsi/score_media_and_why_its_a_massive_candidate_for_a/

Score Media and Gaming, listed on the TSX as SCR and in the US as TSCRF.

These guys have nothing but positive news coming in the next 12 months and has the ability to at least double in the next half year, if not sooner. These guys are foraying into the sports betting market and are the only players that have a fully intuitive and integrated sports scores/stats application on the market.

So what are the positives/catalysts for Score Media:

Expansion with the help/investment of Penn Gaming to expand sportsbook in the US. Keep in mind, Penn is the same company that invested in Barstool. The Score is already approved in New Jersey, Indiana and Colorado, with Iowa right around the corner, and Michigan up next.

Sports betting in Canada is a 14 Billion dollar market. Single wagering is currently illegal, however, there is unity across the aisle between all political parties to amend the criminal code and make single wagering legal. There are currently two bills in play. C-13 and C-218. C-13 second reading is currently delayed, while C-218 is scheduled for the House of Commons on February 24th. Like most countries, they have currently spent a ton of money propping up their respective economies due to COVID-19. It is highly unlikely the Canadian government rejects this massive taxable revenue stream when it needs it the most

Leader in sports applications for time spent on the app on a monthly basis, beating out heavy hitters like TSN, ESPN, Bleacher Report....literally every other sports media application

Only major player with an already existing sports news/fantasy application with seamless sportsbook integration. No hopping back and forth, you can wager through the sports app as if you were on the sportsbook

They are the biggest E-sports media player with over 1 million subscribers on YouTube and that lead is growing

They are pushing to get listed on the NYSE in the very near future to further growth and investment opportunities.

The only real hinderance that could potentially stop the run of this company is if the Canadian government fails to amend the current laws for single game wagering, which in the current economical climate, I find extremely unlikely. ESPECIALLY with support from all political parties including the Conservatives, New Democratic Party, Bloc Quebecois and most Liberal MP's.

Even in the event that this for some reason failed to pass, it still has access to an enormous US market with the backing of Penn.

I love this stock boys and girls!

Curious that you don't have a goaltender in either of your example lineups as it's rare for an optimal Showdown lineup to not contain one.

I can see the argument for not wanting to use one in the early game tonight (in fact, I won't be...Greiss could easily end up in the single digits or negative and I'm concerned Vasilevskiy won't see the volume needed to make value without a shutout), but I can't imagine the late game contests will see a winning lineup without one of the goaltenders.

Completely agree that both Cade and Mamu are must plays.

My value pick is also a stretch, but it‚Äôs PJ Fuller for TCU. Neither team is great defensively, and Fuller is a very cheap player ( 3,600) for hopefully 30 minutes of PT.

I do not use Awesemo Projections as I just did not like it, but I use fantasy cruncher for all of my lineups. The difference is that I have my own algorithm for my projections of each player (I am a Computer Science Major).

If you want to get really good, having the best projection model possible is key. You mostly want projections based on statistics and algorithms, but sometimes manually adjusting your projections based on speculation of what you think a player's projections will be is key too.

Awesemo has the best ownership projections by far and there are no best fantasy points projections from websites in my opinion. The best projections are made by yourself. The best optimizers are Fantasy Labs / Fantasy Cruncher.

I use my custom made projections and upload them into the Fantasy Cruncher Optimizerto come up with my lineups. I pay close attention to all of the new regarding injuries, starting lineups, game postponement, load management, etc.

17,dfsports,"You make some valid points, I still think Ayo is one of the best plays on the slate. Bottom line is he is too cheap and I‚Äôm not too worried about matchup if he‚Äôs playing anyone other than Baylor. Watts could be a potential value play, but he‚Äôs too risky for my liking. His minutes aren‚Äôt guaranteed and he‚Äôs been playing terrible since the start of the season. Micah potters minutes dipped pretty significantly in the last game which makes me kind of skeptical. Aleem Ford is basically the same price and he played 32 minutes in the last game. Of course potter could go off on any given slate, and I‚Äôm very aware Everyone‚Äôs minutes on Wisconsin are very erratic. So it could be potter that gets the boost in minutes and Ford gets the dip, even though Ford played great last game. But I agree at least that Murray‚Äôs recent uptick in minutes is very promising. But ultimately, you really don‚Äôt have to play Ayo; there are plenty of other guys to at up for. In my opinion, Ayo is the best price adjusted play, and I‚Äôm gonna stick to that. Even if he duds and scores like 25. But I really doubt he will. Thanks for the feedback!

18,dfsports,"I don‚Äôt love the Ayo play tbh. Indiana‚Äôs defense has looked surprisingly great the bad few games, and I‚Äôd rather spend that high cash elsewhere. 

With so many BIG games today, I feel like there‚Äôs so many big men to try and play at the same time, therefore I‚Äôll provide some additional value players.

Rocket watts returned as the starting PG. This MSU team might get blown out by 40, but they will still manage to score 60. For 4,100, and hopefully 30 minutes of PT. I like this play for a pretty bad Iowa defense. 

Micah Potter, pretty cheap and great value. I don‚Äôt actually know the stats on PSU‚Äôs defense, but I can‚Äôt imagine harrar guarding Potter effectively. Obviously potter‚Äôs last game was filled with foul trouble and an overall awful performance. But Wisconsin at home against PSU? I‚Äôll take that risk. 

Also love the ke Murray play. Not only has he looked great all season, but Fran finally rewarded him with 32 minutes last game.

A pro can do all the research in the world and get a zero from their best player.

So yes, embrace the variance!  People don‚Äôt like baseball because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what to expect‚Äù which is exactly why they should.  Because the pros don‚Äôt know what to expect either.

You‚Äôre absolutely going to have bad days in baseball.  Don‚Äôt over commit to any one slate.  But in each short slate play to win.

I try my best to get lineups sent out an hour before lock to make sure that people have time to get it in, but I do not quit working on the lineup until lock. I do hours of research every day and try my best on every slate, because these are the lineups that I am personally using.

Just as I try and help people with bankroll management and contest entries to make sure they have the best chance possible to succeed using my lineups.

I also plan on releasing core plays for each slate, rather than just sending full lineups as we grow. Because obviously once there are so many subscribers it isn't viable to send out full lineups and have everyone sharing the money.

Thank you for the questions and feedback though, and I definitely do think that we can agree that a lot(if not MOST) lineup sellers are just in it for money and have no idea what they are doing in most cases lol.

I try and put my money where my mouth is and this is the reason I only play the lineups that I provide, and if I decide that there are some plays that I love in a slate, I make sure to tell people that they can swap certain plays if they like them better, or if I'm playing multiple lineups I let them know.",,1612219898,TestTheLimitTwitch,best_lineups_available

79,dfsports,"I end up with the same lineup as Chipotle a lot. 

It's really simple for max entry; the ""good"" players pick the same or similar cores. 

Then they run it through a lineup generator with different weight settings and create a gradient that gradually shifts from one extension of the core to the other. You normally weight your ""favorite"" core into switching one or two players out to try to hit every variation of that team ""hitting."" 

Upload the CSV, and, bam, now you end up sharing a bunch of lineups with a bunch of other people who had the same cores and ran them through their generators. 

This is ESPECIALLY prevalent in Showdowns, when some games are so obvious, you are sharing lineups with like 30 other people. Every football game a week ago was like that in Showdown, and Chipotle, etc. were all sitting in and out of first with the same goofy lineup I had, just because it was so obvious. But we also had a billion other variations going too. 

What I think you are underestimating is how price value affects cores. If you have a similar core, you only have X amount of dollars to work with, and people start picking the same players to fit in that value, which lowers variations. Optimizers are going to pull a lot of the same people to fit in that value, and you have to manually switch out those people to be different. A lot of people make the same decisions in those cases.",,1612216462,arrogancygames,proof_of_collusion_or_am_i_wrong
0,dfsports,"Then you need to articulate yourself better.

I see your complaint: There are numerous players with duplicate lineups and its no fun playing in a 23 entry contest when 11 of those lineups are duplicated. I get it, you're not wrong.

I see two parts to your accusation:

1. Big name players are working together. But your evidence doesn't support that. A bunch of duplicated lineups in these contests would make ZERO sense for colluding players and would reduce their expected outcome.

2. Big name players are sharing their ""data sets"". I'm still not sure what you mean by ""data set"". I posit that two highly skilled/knowledgeable players working from the set projections are highly likely to independently produce duplicate lineups. NBA is at a point where the best projections win, give everyone access to the same set of numbers they will surely choose the same players (and yes, even in the same slots in their lineup)

&gt;&gt;Why is it only these certain usernames that end up with the same lineup on slates as big as ten games even? 

**The simple answer here goes back to ""the NBA is solved"" and these players have figured it out.** Is the 'right' lineup going to win/cash every night? No, but in the long run it will outperform lesser skilled players. Again, the high bankroll  players aren't winning 100% of their contests, they're winning players because the grind out at a positive EV at high volume. 

There's a 'right' answer to NBA lineups, some people have it and many people don't.

I'm not saying collusion doesn't happen, in fact it absolutely *does*, but not typically in these contests and not typically at the price points that the majority of DFS players are playing on a regular basis.

Imagine entering a $10.6K entry 3-player contest on Fanduel, shortly after you enter Player X joins. Five minutes later Player Y enters. After awhile you notice that Players X and Y seem to join these contests within minutes of each other. More than that their lineups *never* match (contests of this size and at this price point *routinely* chop). Players X and Y are likely colluding by ensuring that their lineups *do not* match, giving them a 2/3 chance at winning the contests and splitting the proceeds. This is the kind of collusion that takes place (there are two top players on FD who are fairly well-known to do exactly this), but there's simply no way that top players are doing this at price points below $500 or so, they're not doing it in a 22 person contest, and their not intentionally matching lineups.

Seriously, look at the results of 3-5 person contests at these higher price points and see how often you see matching lineups, there would be absolutely no incentive to duplicate a lineup contests of that size.",,1612213053,georgethethirteenth,those_people_with_the_same_lineup_in_your_double

I've been a lifelong NBA fanatic, but I only do okay at DFS. My best play is usually in-game showdown contests when you can see how the flow of the game is going and kind of predict minutes for the second half.

11,dfsports,Makes sense. I am definitely going to take some shots this year. I usually try to stick to single entry 1 or 2 dollar tournaments. Usually play everything on DK but I like that Fanduel only does one pitcher so might switch back over for MLB,,1612206724,Arrow_Flash626,does_anyone_have_a_good_story_about_turning_a_dfs
12,dfsports,"I do stack for sure but the stacks come naturally.  Like if I thought the Phillies 2 and 4 hitters were gonna crush I might throw in Harper batting 3rd even in a bad match up.  A lot of times you get the most value out of all star hitters by throwing them in against sub par matchups.

Here is how I do it.  Please note that I specialize in single entry tournaments and ideally smaller slates.

1 - find a pitcher who is expected to win and strike people out.  There is no such thing as too expensive.  Sometimes this is a cheap player, sometimes it‚Äôs not.  On DK you need to find 2.  While I‚Äôm pro DK in every other sport I prefer FD for baseball because of one pitcher.  Anyway, get this right.  Nothing else matters if you screw this up.

2 - Usually I start by finding the lowest priced player (often an outfielder) who I believe can hit a homer.  Many days this is a bench player in a platoon.  A homer at 2500 gets as many points as one from a 5500 player.

3 - Work backwards finding the cheapest potential homer at each position.

4 - With whatever you have left upgrade to superstars.  I might not project Tatis for a homer that day but I‚Äôll take my chances over a bench player in a spot start.

So yeah, work backwards.  Superstar hitters last.

Also, keep in mind that a homer from a Yankee at 33% owned probably costs more than one from a Royal at 2% owned.  There is a legit big market bias in DFS baseball ownership.

Edit - 3 years ago the standard baseball advice was not to stack.  Now everyone does.  In many ways stacking in baseball has jumped the shark bit.  Totally viable but probably done a bit more than it should be these days.

However ... one important note is that while you‚Äôll never see an NBA game double the projected over under you‚Äôll see it almost daily in baseball.  You have to find the game that goes off the rails for it to work in baseball.  A few years ago I had 6 homers from 4 to White Sox so it can work, but it worked more before 2020.",,1612206569,thedkexperience,does_anyone_have_a_good_story_about_turning_a_dfs
13,dfsports,Definitely makes sense. I think I am going to try out your strategy this season with baseball and see if I can make a little bit from it. Having that homer or nothing strat is good but definitely super hard for some positions. Do you team stack or anything? Or just look for the homers,,1612206144,Arrow_Flash626,does_anyone_have_a_good_story_about_turning_a_dfs

Great info, and some of the stuff you wrote i kind of already figured out, but other i thought of but wasn't sure. For sure slot WR's are definitely op. Seems like they are the highest scorers in every game or at least the most consistent and the best value. Oh, yeah and i also like to to look and make sure for let's say like Dalvin Cook, that he is also listed as the PW Back and 3rd down back in the the depth chart. Hit me up if you want to talk some strategy. What i have been doing and it gives me a good play on some deep comatose sleepers is that i will run 20 or so quick sims (with the two teams or players involved, and obv. HAVE TO be exact same roster , with the exact same depth chart and settings or else its pointless. Again, it' s real general but if i watch 20 sims between Arizona and TB and 17 out of those 20 sims Christian Kirk leads Zona in receptions and yards, a more than likely td's .  Well, i'm gonna play Kirk instead of Hopkins . The same can be said for RB's and other WR's . QB play is pretty even or sporadic depending on the match up. i'm gonna play the 11am one today hmu if you want  on here or whatever works no pressure, worries, or hurries.

73,dfsports,"&gt;&gt; When 8 people have the same exact lineup in a 10 game slate it shows they are sharing their data set. 

Can you explain what you mean by ""data set""? 

Are you talking about a set of paid projections then yeah, thousands of people are sharing these every night with their paid subscriptions for RG, Awesemo, etc.?

Are you talking about a set of independently created projections? With the glut of information and analytical tools available to the public then anyone worth their salt is going to come up with similar, if not exact, lineups once they plug those into an optimizer.

As mentioned in your previous thread, the NBA game is ""solved"". Have you solved it? If not, don't get involved in cash games, you WILL lose in the long run.

One thing that doesn't get mentioned, but probably should be when this topic is brought up is that DFS *is not a sports game*. It's a data analysis game. There are thousands of people who sit on their couch and watch basketball every night, see the commercials for Draftkings, think to themselves ""I know the game backwards and forwards, easy money"", and are then shocked when they blow through $500 in a week.

We frame it as a sports game because that's what we enjoy and that what makes it fun, but let me say that again *DFS is not a sports game*. Are you good at data analysis? Recognizing trends? Turning those trends into predictions? Constantly analyzing and tweaking your prediction models? If you answered ""no"" to any one of those questions you're going to be on the losing end in the long run to people who can answer ""yes"".

The NBA is figured out (and other sports will follow, there's too much data out there), unless you have the tools that the top players have *stay away from cash*, MME tournaments and hope to win the lottery of a top prize.

Nobody is cheating you by working together (with occasional exceptions, sure), players have the same lineups because there is essentially a right answer to NBA cash no matter how big the slate is and the information to figure out that answer is readily available.",,1612186409,georgethethirteenth,those_people_with_the_same_lineup_in_your_double

Anyone with a brain is starting to realize what's going on. You can talk about it not being an advantage all you want in cash but it sure as hell is when they pool data set and winnings and they are making sure to get their lineup in as many times as possible since they can only single entry those. People play single entry cash to avoid the other ones where people can max enter 150 lineups into a cash contest. These double ups are a lot harder.

0,dfsports,"Showdowns give you the highest percentage to cash, but more often than not, you'll end up one player off even with max entries and end up not making your investment back. On a ""normal"" night, I'd make 60-70% of what I put in on a max Showdown - the only way you profit is from hitting top 10 every once in a while, which is really hard without multiple entries (and multiples lose you more money). 

It's even worse with the big GPPs with full lineups; you often end up having far less than 50% hit money and those hitting the bottom end of the bubble, making you under 50% back. And it's way harder to get top 10 due to more people playing. 

50/50s give you a much better chance to make money on a given night and to build your bankroll, if that's what you want. I personally only want the big wins at this point for the fun of it; but if you're talking profit and bankroll building, unless you're extremely lucky and hit a big jackpot early enough, 50/50 is always the way to go.",,1612107852,arrogancygames,easier_to_cash_in_gpp_then_5050_nba_dfs

There will be slim differences but the value plays will stand out, yes even on 10 game slates. Really the biggest difference in projections comes from subjective minutes allocation.

I do not think top players are blindly using popular optimizers. I do think that with them being good players, their processes will all gravitate towards the same *best* lineups. Hell, they may even be working together. If they are working together, I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs any worse than people just grabbing lineups from a paid source.

My best guess is that they talk to each other and discuss the best plays, and then go from there. If you play enough slates you‚Äôll notice that they sometimes have different players.

Something I‚Äôve never understood is why they continuously play against each other at high stakes. I feel like cash games are -EV in general at least for NBA with how solved it is, let alone playing against other top players.",,1612056053,chopkins92,proof_of_collusion_or_am_i_wrong

Our Match-Up Tool consists of a chart with how many FPPG on average the team is giving up to each position. It's similar to our NFL Match-Up tool that you might be used to. It's sortable by position and shows the Opponent, spread, and O/U. What we will do down below is show you the Top 5 plays on today's slate per the match-up tool. These are the only plays we like though. Make sure to check out the article with some projections up above. Good luck and let us know if you like this!

For right now I can't see myself with more than 20% exposure to the KC backs and I'm probably off CEH completely. 

I'll have one piece of the Tampa backfield in a√±most all lineups and will probably combine Jones and Lenny in a few.

49,dfsports,"Oh man, I think its tough to make the Succop argument here.

From a raw points perspective Williams is the obvious pick. The floors for these two guys are similar, but Williams definitely projects ahead in the median and FAR ahead when you look at ceilings.

Even from a pts/$ perspective, if I look at my own median projections I've got Williams in the 1.75-2.00 pts/$ range and Succop between 1.9-2.1 pts/$. Even with the price difference between the two you're not getting more efficient in your scoring.

As always the question is: What's that extra $1.4K allowing you to plug into your lineup and maybe that makes the difference for you. Obviously, kicker range of outcomes tend to be a bit more narrow than skill players but, for me, this doesn't look like it'll shape up to be the type of game where a kicker is going to help you all that much. I'd be shocked if Succop (or Butker) is in a winning or optimal lineup.

Obviously still too early to be making definitive statements about this game with over a week to go, but I'd be staying away from both kickers in this game.

&gt;&gt;Especially since you could argue succop is the best pick under 5k in this superbowl slate

There's an complete gift on this slate who's barely more than half the price of Succop that I'm honestly expecting a 4-5X minimum performance from and is going to hit value even at his absolute floor. I couldn't, with a straight face, say that a kicker is the best sub $5K play in this slate, but...Still more than a week to go and I'm often wrong.",,1611933407,georgethethirteenth,darrel_williams_or_ryan_succop_superbowl

28,dfsports,"Nice job and nice cash lineup. Just my two cents here, but I think you're limiting your upside by entering a cash lineup into GPPs. More often than not a cash lineup is gonna end up a little short of the cash line for GPPs. But if you keep a core from your cash line and sub in some lower owned pivots, you have a better shot at a bigger payday. Of course its higher risk, but thats the point of playing gpps.

I recommend playing my lineups with 80% of entries in cash and 20% in gpp.
