I think its pretty easy to see why this pick is must. Capela going against Jokic, one of the worst defenders in the league. Denver takes over 21 points on average over C, while Capela scored 22 points last game against him. I expect 16-17 points and no blowout.

54,sportsbook,"&gt;I bet it with the intention to hedge

..which is a really stupid thing to do, you are literally donating money to the bookies. Both because they give terrible return rates on square long shots, *and* because they take a 2nd cut when you place the hedge bets. 

If your intention is to hedge after 3 wins, you should do the following instead: Take the exact amount you spent on the long shot and place it on Houston ML, and when you win, you take all the winnings and spend it on Houston ML for the next match, and then the same once more. You'd be in the exact same situation as you are now post-hedge, except you'd have a lot more because the return rates on standard odds are higher, and because you wouldn't need to place any hedge bets.

OR you can just keep doing what you're doing, it's your money. I'm just talking from a mathematical standpoint; you're literally donating money to the bookies by playing long shots with the preemptive intention to hedge halfway through.",,1616960969,Away-Mobile7993,houston_4500_future_hedging_advice

Pick: **Portland Trail Blazers -1.5 (-110) vs Toronto Raptors NBA @ 4:00PM PST

Persuasion: The Blazers are a more complete and potent offense. With Damian Lillard returning to the lineup the Raptors really don’t have the guard play to handle Lillard, McCollum, Powell, and Covington. To add to that Nurkic is also returning to the lineup. Revenge game for Powell for trading him so I see this as a statement game for the Blazers to want to rally around that energy.

Dallas came on strong in the third period and overtime yesterday.  I think Florida will take the Stars a bit more seriously tonight.

This hinges on Blackwood being in goal for New Jersey. He has a 2-0-1 record against the Bruins this year. In those game only 5 goals were allowed on 92 shots. In the other goal, Rask is still out leaving duties up to Halak. He has been starting a lot more than expected this year and might be running out of gas. He gave up 4 to the Islanders in his last start.  I'm taking the over because I expect a 4-2 Devils win.

POTD Record 3-0

Last Pick: Raps/Suns over 54.5 1Q

Analysis’s have been spot on.

History

1. Raptors -1.5 (+131 or 2.3) ✅
2. Kings -5 (+130 or 2.3) ✅ 
3. Raps/Suns over 54.5 ✅

POTD: Raptors/Portland Under 230.5

Analysis: Raptors have picked up defensively and are clicking everywhere. I expect them to upset a lot of people in the upcoming weeks as the team finds their defensive identity once again. They held the Suns to 104 Points as they held Booker to 6/14 shooting while only scoring 16 with 4 turnovers. 

Lilliard is expected tonight but has been having a bad stretch due to a finger injury that continues to still bother him.

 Portland has been shooting red hot from 3, 44% on this road trip. I expect reality to kick in as all of them besides CJ are in the 30-38%.",,1616955689,nsanesian,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

FSU also is a bottom tier team in turnover rate and although Michigan doesn't generate turnovers I do believe they will create more than average today. Also think FSU will go on long offensive droughts.",,1616953826,Ogsports2,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

54,sportsbook,"252-247-6 -15.46u  yesterday: 2-4  this is what happens when you pick against Oregon State

**Creighton +13.5 vs. Gonzaga**  pretty much the number I had it at..guess I'll take the points. Creighton is a very skilled offense that can keep up if they play their best, which is a big if given they were inconsistent all season, but still. and they had their best defense in a long time. High potential for backdoor cover here as well. 

**Florida State +2.5 vs Michigan** should be a really tight one..I think FSU has to be pretty happy with how its defense played in the NCAAT so far given it wasn't that good in the regular season at times. Turnovers have been the Seminoles biggest problem but Michigan's defense is in the 330s in turnover rate, and if FSU can get out and run they will be a matchup problem. 

**UCLA +6.5 vs. Alabama** Who am I to say the Pac-12 won't keep up it's nearly perfect record ATS. With two scorers playing as well as Juzang and Jaquez are right now they certainly can keep up offensively. If bama shoots 3s like they did against Maryland it's over but been a little inconsistent in that regard the past six weeks. 

**USC -2 vs Oregon** Was a big matchup problem for Oregon in the regular season meeting. Dana Altman will make some adjustments and it will be closer, but overcoming Evan Mobley inside and USC's rebounding and ability to get to the free throw line for an undersized team will be tough. I said the same against Iowa and was way off, but USC's defense is obviously on a much different level. 

**Louisiana Tech +1.5 vs. Colorado State** Nothing much on this one but just for fun..teams at the same level for me but LT's defense should be the best unit on the floor.",,1616952847,SeattleDegenerate21,ncaabb_daily_discussion_32821_sunday

You're talking about FAA being a mental midget. Every tennis player has flaws and you'd never make a tennis bet if you were to make a case for every single one. **Isner had arrived at the ATP Miami Open with just two wins to his name in 2021**, FAA reached the final at the ATP Murray River Open and the fourth round at the Australian Open.

Granted it requires you being much more intentional about your lineup construction but I think it adds more value to doing a ton of research or using optimizers/projection tools. It also prevents you from having to worry about over-exposure to your core because you should only be playing one lineup. With cash though I would lean towards projections rather than gut because with such condensed ownership you can’t really afford to get away from chalk when some guys are clearly much more optimal than others each slate.

They were very big on both SGA and Tony Bradley yesterday and didn't say anything about Nickeil Alexander-Walker even though he's been playing more minutes lately and was in a good matchup. I went ahead and played him in a handful of lineups and was thankful I did. But I also played too much Bradley and suffered because of it.

There's always going to be some randomness, which is why the person at the top of the GPPs every night usually has someone who was 5% or less owned.

78,dfsports,Yup I definitely will read a couple quick articles but the ownership usually tells you things like Moses popping.. then it’s adjusting the mix to taste.  Tonight’s a great example of where lately I’d hone in on Houston game or  Sacramento game  but so many more options to leverage for gpp.  just going to be more careful with low salary chalk.  1-2 vs 3-4 guys,,1615993762,loyaltystar,information_overload_phenomena
79,dfsports,"Sometimes the content is right though. Moses Brown was good chalk and I wasn't thinking about him the night before when I started looking at pricing. Usually OKC goes with Roby but this guy was 3.5k and put up 50+ points. Yes please!

Tonight a bunch of Houston guys should pop. Porter Jr without Wall and Oladipo, sign me up. I have a hard time believing that Wood is going to play, and if he does, how much is he going to play, so I'll avoid him. I will probably go back to Martin Jr at PF because he should get minutes in garbage time, so should Porter Jr. 

On Rotogrinders I believe Court IQ is still free. You can remove all the injured/traded players and it'll show you how many minutes they've played without those guys on the court, how much their production goes up, what their usage is like and useful info like that. For example, if you Remove Bam off, Jimmy Buckets goes to like 1.58 points a minute. And if you look further you can see he get something like a .19 fantasy boost per minute (I think that's what the bottom section is for). It's not foolproof but it sure helpful.",,1615992157,ChrisJr03,information_overload_phenomena

4,dfsports,"One thing I've learned from playing is to think about the volatility of the ""chalk"". Like last night - Poku (I can't spell his name). 

I knew the risks going in, but, he's playing minutes and minutes = points (in theory). He also only shot 2-9 so the volume was there and if he was making his shot, say, like 7-9, he would have got somewhere in the 20's pointwise. I can live with that although it's not great.

I use Rotogrinders and for me it does help. I really get rid of the players I don't want it makes the lineup optomizer pretty good.

9,dfsports,"&gt; And when I say knowledge, I mean from a fan perspective not a DFS perspective

I'm gonna disagree with this - just slightly.

NBA DFS has, to some extent, been solved. If you haven't got the 'right' projections (whether they're your own or paid for) then I wouldn't bother playing NBA at this point. You don't need DFS knowledge *or* basketball knowledge for this part. You need the numbers and you need just a little bit of analytical knowledge - with the right numbers it's almost plug and play, but not quite.

Basketball knowledge does help in the ~90 minutes leading up to lock. Injury news, late scratches, etc - you need to know not only who's getting newly freed up minutes, but how those personnel combos are going to affect the play on the floor. If you know that, then you can gain an edge over those players who are simply plug-and-playing based on the numbers...*but* if you don't have those numbers yourself you're going to be sunk in the long term.

It's no fun for the actual basketball fan and I'm sorry to say it, but AI, algorithms, and our robot overlords have won the NBA DFS war. If you want to win, join them.",,1615900505,georgethethirteenth,how_do_i_get_better_at_nba_dfs

NBA is the exact opposite of MMA due to the projectable nature of basketball games and the general reliability of rotations on a game to game basis.

Unfortunately I work full time with a 1 year old, and the only time off I have from work is the winter season (which doesn't help at all if there's no baseball). I've become very much involved with baseball Analytics and the mechanics of hitters/pitchers, understanding what the different metrics and stats mean and how they're calculated.. I spent the last 3 months developing a pretty sophisticated workbook (atleast in my opinion) full of hitter &amp; pitcher projections for the season using a combination of 7 different expert projections and weighing them with historical performances (based on 2 years, 1st &amp; 2nd half of season, rookie vs veteran development from season to season for the different age groups, ..etc) ...


I doubt I qualify for this opportunity simply because of my busy schedule, but I'd really like to get in touch and see how I could be of some help in maybe providing the workbook I've put together ? Maybe it's something that could be of use to you? And I'm not looking for anything (payments), I just want your opinions on what I've done and get some insight or feedback if possible?

For example the $20 150max that's up for NBA right now.. only like 170 people could max that and the contest would be full. There's going to be far, far, far more than 170 individual people playing in that. The mass majority aren't actually max entering.

Now for the smaller ones like the $1 20max yeah I'm sure a much higher % are maxing it out.",,1615551924,LiberDBell,jesus_im_getting_crucified_out_here

32,dfsports,"I bet primarily through Rivers Illinois and bet sports/play dfs professionally. The rivers casino terms and conditions / rules actually don’t explicitly state anything about a maximum payout. But I thought you might find the below interesting, a walkthrough of how to use their “really high payout parlay generator”. 

https://helpcenter.il.betrivers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048560474-What-is-the-Jackpot-Parlay-Feature-


 I can however tell you that from my own personal experience, that limit sits around $250,000. If I wanted to place a bet with a payout higher than $250,000 I would have to send it to a trader at the casino for manual approval but have never once had a problem getting it accepted within a couple minutes. 

While William hill may have a (disgustingly low) payout limit, I really don’t think you understand how that would even work. No that does not mean if you concocted a parlay with William hill that would payout at +10000000000000 and put $1 on it that they would accept the bet, and if it hit go, “oh tough shit our Max payout is 720-1, here’s $720 take it or leave it.”, they wouldn’t let you place it in the first place, they’d tell you sorry this exceeds our payout limit we can’t take this bet.

It would get flagged to a trader and they would greenlight it, then get on Teams to marketing so they are aware. I’ve worked in bookmaker Head Offices, I know how these things work. If someone gets lucky and wins big off fuck all stake, you market the shit out of them. They’ve probably paid out on parlays with bigger payouts than $90k in the last year. I know someone who won $20k off a 20-leg parlay with a **free bet** and he got his money as soon as the last leg landed.

I don’t make these kind of bets so you won’t see me on here, and if I did win $90k then I certainly wouldn’t be posting it on Reddit.",,1615304660,AdministrativeLaugh2,look_at_this_crazy_parlay_lol

36,dfsports,"I am not new to this. I am not saying $90k exceeds their payout limit I am saying that the odds on that bet exceed anything they would reasonably pay. As I pointed out William Hill caps max parlay payout odds at +72000, that is a long way off +34415887. While Draftkings does not explicitly state a cutoff they do state in their terms:

&gt; These Rules are applicable to all transactions with DraftKings Sportsbook and may be supplemented at any time in DraftKings’ sole discretion. In the event that any of these Rules conflict with the Terms, the Terms shall govern.

&gt; In cases where it deems that these Rules are inconclusive, DraftKings reserves the right, according to its own discretion, to settle offers on an individual basis on the basis of equity, attaining itself to generally accepted betting norms, customs and definitions.

And just for laughs I took a look at the notoriously player unfriendly Barstool Sportsbook's house rules where no max amounts, payouts, or odds are listed:

&gt;As mentioned in these House Rules, the Operator reserves the right to limit the net payout (the payout after the stake has been deducted) on any bet or combination of bets, by one Account Holder or any group of Customers/Account Holders acting together.


I agree with you that when you consider the PR/marketing perspective it would probably be in their interest to pay a bet like this. The issue for a bettor would be getting enough attention to make it worth it for them. 

What I am saying is that they would not do this without a fight. They could easily point to how their rules don't conclusively address the issue and cite industry norms such as William Hills rules or god forbid BSS.

Obviously I am not going to change your mind on this so I hope that down the road you prove me wrong and reply to this with an insane slip.

They have no history of not paying out.

$90k is literally nothing to them and parlays like this hitting is essentially free publicity. It would be a PR disaster if they just said “Nah we’re not paying you out cause it was only a 26c wager and our vague rules say we don’t have to.” Everyone would just migrate over to FanDuel or another book.

3,dfsports,"No. This is not commentary on who I think will win the fight I am just trying to make the point that you should never bet the house on anyone. Whatever you were willing to bet I would bet 5% of. Betting too high of a percentage of your bankroll can bankrupt pretty much any strategy long term.

For example, Sportsbooks are currently giving Medic about a 63% of winning the fight. Let's say you evaluate the fight and correctly say he has a 73% of winning the fight. Giving you a 10% edge over the sportsbooks (Which is really really good).

If you start with $100 bankroll, your bets have a 10% edge, and lets say you don't bet 100% of your bankroll each bet but you bet 50% instead. If you made 1000 bets with this criteria you would finish with more than the $100 you initially had about 33 out of 100 times.

But... If you start with $100 bankroll, your bets have a 10% edge, and you bet 5% of your bankroll each bet. If you made 1000 bets with this criteria instead you would finish with more than the $100 you initially had about 100 out of 100 times. 

You also not only have a much smaller chance of losing money but the total amount made is higher with the 5% betting strategy as well.",,1614876463,Huge-Bulge,should_i_bet_the_house_on_uros_medic
