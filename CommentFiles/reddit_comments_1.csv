Last Pick Analysis: Didn't have time to watch this game but Denver really pulled off a great second half and narrowly pulled it off. Great win with risking 2 units. On to the next!

Sport: NBA
Time: 7:00 PM EST
Pick: Portland @ Toronto 1H Total OVER 119 @ +115 (2u)

I know I said I'm holding off on totals for a bit, but these are two teams that are bottom 5 in defensive rating over the last 10 games (Portland last and Raptors #26). Toronto is also number 7 in pace over that timeframe, and while the Blazers aren't one of the faster paced teams, they have a positive over percentage at 55.6% (same for the Raptors) so I'm not too worried. 
What really sold me about this line is the fact that the Blazers average first half total is a whopping 122.2 in their last 5 games, while the Raptors are at 114. Keep in mind that the average defensive rating of the teams Toronto has faced in that span is 110.4, while Portland's is 116.8. Theoretically, if Toronto played those games against the Blazers' defense, their average 1H point total would be 120.6. For what it's worth, using this same formula the Blazers' 1H total would be 121.66. For the sake of simplicity I'm averaging this out and rounding down to 121. Is this a valid model to find a predicted line? Who knows, probably not, but it's obvious that they're gonna go over 119. Feel free to adjust the line if you like.

As always, bet at your own risk and....

*Tables will be updated during the day as all lines and odds are not all out yet on Pinnacle.*

This post is just to show some interesting stats from the previous games, **THESE ARE NOT PLACED BETS**. To see more statistics and interesting picks check my website ([SaveOneBet](https://www.saveonebet.com/))

Over Odd, Under Odd and lines are from Pinnacle and correspond to actual line and odds of player prop for next game. The games (game-1, etc) correspond to last games played by the player along with its stats.

# Top 10 best % Over/Under last 5 games

*Ordered list of pick by best percentage of over/under vs. actual line over the 5 last games*

*Ex: if over the last 5 games the player is always 5/5 under OR over the actual line he will be at the top of the list. On the opposite if the player is 2/5 or 3/5 under OR over he will be at the bottom.*

Last pick: EG ML vs Fnatic@1.68 (lost)  


Unlucky bet last time, EG threw some extremaly dumb rounds and lost the decider map because of it. Today we are betting on them again tho.  


**EG map1** vs Liquid@2.05 2U (19:00 CET)  
EG is picking first map in this match and I am pretty confident they will pick Inferno - clearly their best map. So far, this event, on Inferno they won vs Astralis and Fnatic, lost in overtime vs VP. Wins vs Astralis (probably still #1 in the world) and fnatic were clean, while vs VP they lost after tough battle.   
Liquid played this map only once in EPL - won vs Endpoint (16-12), not the best team out there, they should have won and did it. Additional factor thats super important here - EG have to win this match to still have a chance to qualify to playoffs, so we shouldn't be worried about their motivation. Last time these teams faced off in January and Liquid won 2-0, including 16-12 on Inferno, but EG changed their roster (for better) since then. Good luck!

Day 28

Back with more picks for the remaining sweet 16 games. A great day yesterday finishing up 4.84 units, let‚Äôs try and keep it going today!

47-38

\+13.09

**Creighton 1H ML +320 (1 unit)**

I mentioned yesterday we could see slow starts from favorites because of the unusual format of this year‚Äôs tournament, and it certainly worked out in my favor. I‚Äôll go to that well one more time with Creighton here. They‚Äôre a very good team with a volume scorer and are getting a huge number to lead at halftime. We all know Gonzaga can turn it on and end up covering this game in a span of five minutes, so I‚Äôm hoping for a game script similar to their win over BYU a few weeks ago.

**Michigan -2 (1 unit)**

After avoiding Michigan games altogether since the Livers injury, I guess they‚Äôre going to survive long enough to force my hand. I‚Äôve loved watching this team play all year and will end up laying the small number. Michigan shoots lights out from the free throw line, and has enough outside shooting to win this game. I‚Äôm worried about turnovers and foul trouble for Dickinson, but I‚Äôll take talent over depth and size in this one.

**Alabama -7 (2 units)**

With the best defense left in the tournament and an insanely high volume offense, this has got to be the most dangerous team remaining. Add to that UCLA has not played good defense of late despite having a defensive minded coach. Even if UCLA can hang in there for a half, I don‚Äôt see them keeping Bama from eventually making a lot of threes. I‚Äôd be willing to lay up to 8 or 9 here, so I‚Äôll put an extra unit on the 7. 

**Oregon ML +110 (1 unit)**

My favorite game of the day, this PAC 12 rematch should live up to the hype. Oregon is certainly going to have trouble scoring like they did against Iowa, but I don‚Äôt think they are going to need to. I expect a close hard fought game here that will come down to the final few minutes. Oregon‚Äôs guards shoot much better from the line than USC and won‚Äôt turn the ball over as much, so I‚Äôll let those be my tiebreakers and take the ducks on the ML.",,1616936354,chalktalkbets,ncaabb_daily_discussion_32821_sunday

NCAA Basketball: Gonzaga vs Creighton (2:10pm)

Creighton's coach said in an interview if ya cant beat Gonzaga ya have to join them.  Implying they have to come out shooting and not do what other teams have done.

Zags are 1st in pts per possesion and Creighton is 40th.  This should be a shootout.  Creighton will have to play near perfect, hit their 3s and have solid games from their starters to win this/stay close. I think they jack up 3s to keep pace and hope its close the last 5 min and try to get the win. 

Gonzaga will get 85 to 90 pts.  The question is if Creighton can score in the 70s?  I think they will so the over is my play.

&amp;#x200B;

**Last Pick:** NBA - \*\***CHI Bulls ML** vs SA Spurs **(2.3@5u)**

**Last Pick Analysis:** Actual game line is CHI+3.5. DECENT RISK - BE CAREFUL as always. I like it until CHI -5.5. The Spurs are looking to break their 4G L-streak here, while the Bulls are looking to get back at the Spurs for the 4Q beating they took in their previous matchup. CHI was leading by as much as 20 points, only to lose late in the 4Q. CHI got rid of WCJ and the veteran Otto, but got Vooch in return. Today will be Vooch's first game, and he'll definitely be looking to shine, playing alongside Lavine. Poeltl isn't a match for Vooch, so the Spurs will definitely need to send double teams every now and then in the low post, forcing Vooch to kickout to the nearest shooter. I think the Bulls dynamic will change here, probably averaging more 3pt attempts than usual (usually 30 attempts - looking at around 39ish) because of Vooch's arrival. Expecting White, Lauri and Lavine to all have higher 3pt makes due to better looks. Also important to note that (in a 10 game sample size), CHI is ranked 7th in backcourt defensive efficiency, and 2nd in 3pt defensive efficiency (backcourt too). Another point I like is that the maestro Thad Young will likely lead the 2nd unit with White, and though White isn't great, I consider it decent firepower against the very thin SAS bench. My only worry is Vooch's slow &amp; lackluster defense might be exploited by Coach Pop. However, I'm still expecting CHI to completely dominate this game, and win 126-111 (Higher than their usual scoring).

&gt;**Last Pick Afterthoughts:** OK FOUR 5U LOSSES IN A ROW THIS IS FRUSTRATING. Bulls took a lot of 3s, BUT NEVER HIT THEM. THEY SHOT 8 of 34 3s. How horrendous. Entire team played like how we expected, getting good looks beyond the arc, but just not hitting them. That is just sad. Young seems slightly lost in his new role, and the entire team just gave up so many TOs in the first half alone. They finally picked up and started catching up in the 4Q, but it was already too late. Way too difficult to overcome a 36pt lead in the 3Q. Vooch played with 0 heart. His offense is really good, but man,  does he have the defensive IQ of a rock or what. Coach Pop really did exploit this by running double cutters and backscreened runners into Vooch and just confusing him like a lost guppy. Plus the man just plays with zero heart. I hate that. SAS won 120-104. Apologies boys.

ON TO THE NEXT, Degens!

**POTD**\*\*: click-&gt; &gt;!NBA - \*\* ALT LINE TOR Raptors -5 vs POR Tblazers (2.56@5u)  !&lt;

&gt;!Analysis: Actual game line is TOR-1.5. BIG RISK - BE CAREFUL as always. I like it until TOR -8.5. I'm going with TOR again here. Putting my faith in statistics above emotion. TOR lost big for us in a 5u b2b, but this time I feel they're back. TOR has exceptional 3pt backcourt defensive efficiency, currently 6th in the league (recent 10 game sample size), while POR is ranked 2nd from the bottom. For frontcourt, POR ranks last in the league in 3pt defensive efficiency (same 10 game sample size). TOR loves to put up 3s almost as much as UTA does, and should have a sizeable lead because of this. TOR is also first in the league in team forced TOs when OG is playing, vs POR's bottom 10th ranking. Expecting the main TOR squad to go wild here, hopefully shooting lights out from beyond the arc. Also looking for a big game from Gary Trent Jr against his former team, with 6+ 3s. Norm will be norm, but I'm expecting OG to be his usual disruptive self, and contain POR overall. OG is pretty much the key to TOR winning in any given night. Siakam has also been playing angry in the past few, trying to prove a point to Coach Nick Nurse, and I'm expecting him to be the same All Star in this one. Expecting around 20 of 47 attempts to drop from beyond the arc for TOR here. Hopefully Dame Time is flustered tonight. Looking at TOR to win here 127-114. I really don't want to go under 50u profit here. We NEED this win Raps!!!!&lt;

Kosovo has already impressed us with their significant improvement over the past few years. The coach Bernard Challandes is responsible for the rise of Kosovo. The Swiss managed to build a strong team that plays beautiful possessive football. The stars of the teams Vedat Muriqui, Milot Rashica, Amir Rrahmani, Mergim Vojvoda, Arber Zeneli will be the main thread for the Swedish defence.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has already returned to the national selection of Sweden after a 5-year break. The impact of Ibra was vivid after only a few minutes as he made a marvellous assist for the 1-0 win over Georgia. Today the Swedish will be determined to take another 3 points and get closer to World Cup Finals in Qatar.

Kosovo is known for their attacking style and today they will do all it takes to score a goal at least. Considering the supremacy of Sweden, the team is expected to score either. Seeing goals on both nets is very likely to happen.

Alabama Vs UCLA 7:15pm EST
Play: Alabama -6

Don‚Äôt look now but Mick Cronin has UCLA playing some fantastic basketball right now. A team that was plagued by inconsistency throughout the season has reeled off 3 straight as an 11 seed. They had wins over Michigan State and BYU which on paper looked like good wins. However, I think both teams were overrated and BYU could not buy a 3 in that game. Their win over Abilene Christian really isn‚Äôt anything to write home about either. This will be their first real test of the tournament and it comes against an Alabama team under one of the best coaches in the country. The Crimson Tide just Rolled right over the Maryland Terps, a very good defensive team, and hit 16 three pointers on the way to a 19 point victory. A big thing here is that guard Joshua Primo was back from injury and looked healthy. They were missing him in the Iona game and it showed. This is a team that can run almost any team in the country out of the gym on any given night. UCLA is 212th in the country at defending the 3 and that is really going to hurt them in this matchup. On the flip side Bama is one of the better defenses UCLA has faced all season and this game just doesn‚Äôt feel like it will be close. I‚Äôll take Bama with the points and I think they probably win by double digits here. 


Lastly, I had a few people request it so I‚Äôll just post it here.

**POTD: UCLA +7 vs. Alabama @ 1.95 (-105)** \[NCAAB\] - 01:15 CET

**Ducky‚Äôs Breakdown:**

UCLA is just a solid team across the board. They are 15th in offensive efficiency, scoring 113 points in every 100 possessions. They are 66th in defensive efficiency, allowing only 94 pts in every 100 possessions. UCLA is also 13th in the nation at 3p%, shooting 38.9%, as well as 19th in FG%, shooting 48%. They are just an efficient and well run team. They face a very tough test in Alabama this weekend as they are one of the best teams in the tournament.

As you can see here, there aren‚Äôt many advantages for either side. Any advantage that Alabama has, UCLA pretty much matches or is slightly behind them. There are two that stick out: Consistency and Pace.

UCLA is one of the more consistent teams in the tournament. They are methodical and you always know what you‚Äôll get from them- efficiency. Alabama, on the other hand, is erratic but talented as hell. You never know which Alabama team you will get - the one who‚Äôs going to kill you, or the weird one with the tail between its legs.

Pace is the other major difference here. This is a battle between the tortoise and the heir. UCLA being the tortoise (337th in pace) and Alabama being the heir (19th in pace). This is actually an advantage for UCLA, in my opinion, as if they‚Äôre able to slow Alabama to their pace it will make Bama uncomfortable and cause them to make more mistakes.

Some fun stats:

* When facing teams that have an offensive near-proximity FG% less than 63.5%, UCLA performs better than the norm 64% of the time. Alabama‚Äôs near-proximity FG% is 58%.
* When facing teams that have a second-chance potential point rate greater than 12.6, UCLA is more efficient than normal 50% of the time. Alabama has a second-chance potential point rate or 17.34.

Final Thoughts:

This should be a close game at the end. Ultimately, I think Alabama squeaks out a win, but UCLA will put up a fight. I also would not be surprised if they outright win the game. All we need is UCLA to not lose by more than 6 points and I think that happens here.

**Fooxied‚Äôs Breakdown:**

Most of my friendly cappers and also the public money is on the side of Alabama and even before the bracket, I would also bet on them, but recent games have shown their weaknesses.

Since beating Michigan State in the First Four, the Bruins have been on a roll and one of the main reasons is the play of great guard Johnny Juzang, who is averaging 22.3 ppg in the last 3 games. The Bruin defense was fantastic against the ACU shooters in the 67-47 win, the team was excellent from the start offensively and the rebounding has been there.

Alabama shoots a whole lot of threes, but UCLA has been okay against the Pac-12 teams. It‚Äôs a better shooting team from the outside and it‚Äôs going to roll on the free throw line. The Tide limited the fouls in the 96-77 win over Maryland, but it‚Äôs usually putting teams on the line at least ten times and UCLA should pounce. The Bruins are a whole lot stronger from the line than they showed against Abilene Christian.

Both teams have shot the ball well from 3-point range in the tournament. UCLA is 24 of 56 (42.9 percent) in three games. Alabama is 21 of 47 (44.7%) in two games. Both teams also have defended the 3-point line well. The Crimson Tide's opponents are 15 of 50 (30 percent) in those two games, and the Bruins' opponents are 13 of 51 (25.5 percent). Alabama is 11-1 SU in the last 12 games, but 6-6 ATS in those. UCLA was shaky before bracket, but since then they are 3-0 ATS in bracket games, all wins with a significant advantage of points.

Underdogs are doing extremely well in the tournament, most games are really close. As I mentioned, I would bet on Alabama before the bracket, but the recent games of both teams show quite different trends. I didn't think UCLA would make it that far, I don't think they can win this game, but the spread Vegas is offering us has some good value. I think it should be closer to 4.5 which is why I think UCLA is a good choice here.

Today's Pick: Washington Capitals ML  vs New York Rangers (Under 6.5 Goals -125)

&amp;#x200B;

The Capitals come into today's matchup as one of the hottest teams in the league. They are 12-6 on home ice, while the Rangers are 8-9 away. The Capitals are 12-2 when they are the favored team in a game. The Capitals have really been playing a much better defensive game lately, with the majority of their losses coming in the very beginning of the season. In the Month of March their games have gone 8-4 for the Under 6.5 goals

The New York Rangers come in to todays game on less than 24 hours of rest and it's an away game for them. Typically when we see a game like this it favors the under. When you have a little less jump in your step you like to dump the puck in a lot or flip it out of your zone which I think we'll see a lot of today. 

These teams are 4-0 on unders for the season averaging just 4.5 goals in those games. The Rangers have been one of, if not the best, teams in the league at defending the Capitals allowing just 1.5 goals per game in their 4 matchups so far.

I went back and forth a bit between the under 6.5 or the Capitals ML. I'm putting my $$ on the under because there's always that one team that just matches up and plays against a better team and finds a way to win. I expect this to be a 3-2 game with pretty tight play and not a ton of scoring opportunities.",,1616931169,ghost3737,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

78,sportsbook,"Record: 2-0-0, tennis was good to me paat 2 days, however with the match i had in mind for today got pushed to probably even after next thread is opened, switching up to basketball as my next pick. Playing progression (Aiming between 1.5 - 2 odds until 3 wins, then start over with my entry bet / 1/10 of total bank).


Previous pick: Fucsovic M. - Kokkinakis T; Fucsovic to win 1.7 W


Todays pick: Basketball | ABA Liga | 11:00 EST

KK Zadar - KK Igokea Aleksandrovac; Igokea - 4.5, odd 1.65



Igokea, positioned 3rd on the table, is visiting Zadar, sitting at 11th place. Igokea is definitely playing one of the best basketball in the league, and it's a no surprise they're ranked 3rd. That, and the fact last game they played was 5 days ago (trip to Tenerife, champions league match, lost 75-80, though the game was close up to the 4th quarter) makes me believe they'll have no issues covering this number.


Zadar on the other hand is playing sporadically throughout the season - They're winning games in local Croatia league, but losing in ABA League almost consistently (Last 6 games, only 1 win vs 10th placed Borac by 2 points at home). However, unlike Igokea, last game they played was yesterday, where they won on away trip to Zabok. Coach of Zadar even said that the schedule's been tough on them, and that they will enter this match completely unprepared due to the time between these 2 games. 


Last match they played H2H was in December last year, Igokea being the host - they sweeped Zadar 72-48.



With all that being said, Igokea winning by 5 points or more is my go to bet for today. In case your book doesn't have this spread, i would probably go up to - 6.5 points and still feel safe about the pick.

the big 10 has shown their true colors this tournament, (as a ridiculously overrated conference), and are still without their star player, isaiah livers.

michigan has looked very unconvincing in their first 2 games in the tournament, beating texas southern by 16 and LSU by 8...having to score in the 80s each game to do so. they will not be able to do score that much against FSU. michigan‚Äôs size won‚Äôt be much of an advantage today considering fsu is a bigger team. 

florida state has been playing lockdown defense all tourney, only allowing opponent‚Äôs to shoot 33.6% from the field.  they also are extremely efficient on offense (ranked #15 in kenpoms offensive efficiency ratings).

**NIT**

**Memphis -4** The Tigers have been rolling through teams-**10-2 in their last 12**.   Their only losses were at Houston by 3 and a ridiculous shot at the buzzer and by 2 to the Cougars in the AAC Tournament.  

That's the same Houston team that killed Syracuse last night and is now on the brink of the Final Four. 

**NCAA**

**Gonzaga first half spread and game** \- Much like Baylor against Villanova-Gonzaga is just a better team. 

Not to mention, Creighton has also been less than spectacular lately.

They **lost to Georgetown by 25 in the Big East tournament** and beat UC Santa Barbara by just one on the first round of the Big Dance.üíÉ 

The **Bluejays are also one of the worst free throw shooting teams in the country** which should allow the Zags to keep picking up points until eventually they're up 15. 

**Alabama -5.5** \- That Pac-12 has definitely represented but the Bruins are simply outgunned here athletically. 

The big difference should be the three point line where **Alabama has allowed its opponents to shoot just 28.9% for the season.** 

That's **eighth best in the country.**

That's it for now. 

I will research a few other games and post on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/CoolhandClint7)**-**as well as any in game live picks that I like.

52,sportsbook,"#  Romania vs Germany

The home side had a successful start to the campaign after picking all three points against Northern Macedonia. Romania celebrated a 3:2 victory, but they almost spilled two points despite a 2:0 lead. Ianis Hagi and the lads enjoy a good run since they failed to win only once on the previous four occasions. However, we won‚Äôt be seeing them in EURO since Romania missed both chances to qualify for the final tournament. They finished 4th in the group and also missed the opportunity to secure playoffs in the UEFA Nations League. Mirel Radoi‚Äôs side has been pretty efficient lately, especially when playing at home. In the last three games at Arena Nationala, Romania scored eleven goals. The hosts look forward to putting another good display to pick at least a point from this match.

Germany also met the expectations in their opening match in these qualifiers by beating Iceland 3:0. Joachim Low‚Äôs side is the strongest favorite in this group, and the visitors want to secure the top spot. They had a very successful campaign in the EURO quals, where they booked seven wins in eight games. However, a heavy 6:0 defeat against Spain in the UEFA Nations League prevented them from challenging that trophy. Ilkay Gundogan and the lads perfectly opened the clash against Iceland by scoring two goals in the first 7 minutes. It was their second game to keep the clean sheet from the previous ten occasions. Germany wants to show dominance in this group and will search for a victory in Bucharest

Full-Time Winner Odds &amp; Prediction

Despite Romania‚Äôs excellent recent form, Germany is a firm favorite to win this clash. We believe they will meet the expectations and celebrate by two goals at least.

Goals Market Prediction

Their head-to-head clashes have always been a joy to watch. None of the sides managed to keep the clean sheet in their four encounters, and just one match stayed under a 2.5 margin. We expect to see at least three goals in total in this game.

**Germany AH -1.5 @ 1.85**

**Over 2.5 FT @ 1.55**

**Correct score 1:3 @ 11.00**",,1616920691,bat-bet,soccer_daily_discussion_32821_sunday
53,sportsbook,"#  Bulgaria vs Italy

Bulgaria had a poor start in the World Cup Quals after losing against Switzerland at home. They lost the game already in the locker room, as Switzerland had a 3:0 lead after just 12 minutes into the game. Yasen Petrov‚Äôs side managed only to score a consolation goal at the beginning of the second half. The hosts failed to qualify for EURO as well since they picked only six points in their group. Bulgaria also got relegated from the UEFA Nations League Division B, where they remained undefeated only twice. Kiril Despodov and the lads celebrated only once on the previous ten games, and that victory came in a friendly match against Gibraltar. The home side needs to improve a lot to win something from this game.

Italy had a confident start to the campaign after beating Northern Ireland 2:0 at home. Domenico Berardi and Ciro Immobile scored before the halftime break, and after that, everything was a routine. The visitors are the top favorites for winning 1st place in the group, but Switzerland will search for its chance. Roberto Mancini‚Äôs side has been pretty convincing lately as Italy hasn‚Äôt lost its previous 23 games in all competition. They were perfect in the EURO Quals after winning the group with all ten victories. Azzurri will also have the chance to challenge the UEFA Nations League trophy, as they qualified for the final tournament. Leonardo Bonucci and the lads have been almost unbeatable in the back, as they conceded just once on the previous eight occasions. The visitors want to keep up where they left off and celebrate another important victory.

Full-Time Winner Odds &amp; Prediction

Italy is a strong favorite in this match, and everything except the away side‚Äôs win would be a surprise. The visitors should secure the advantage already in the first half.

Goals Market Prediction

Bulgaria has severe troubles converting its chances into goals, while Italy is excellent in the back. Therefore, we think the away side might keep the clean sheet for the fifth time in a row.

**Italy HT-FT @ 1.65**

**BTTS No @ 1.55**

**Correct score 0:2 @ 6.00**",,1616920669,bat-bet,soccer_daily_discussion_32821_sunday
54,sportsbook,"Pick: Bray Wanderers (1.67) v Treaty United

Sport: Soccer

Competition: League of Ireland First Division

Bray Wanderers competed in the First Division last year, the second highest tier of Irish soccer, and came a single point shy of automatic promotion. They had the best defensive record in the league, conceding 13 goals in a truncated due to Covid season. When playing at home, they conceded 3 in 9 games.

This year, they're not the favourites to win promotion due to the quality of the teams relegated from the Premier Division last season, ie Cork City and Shelbourne. However, Bray are a legitimate First Division side, with pedigree in the competition and should certainly be considered the 'best of the rest', with the only real competition for third place coming in the form of Galway United.

Treaty United were granted a license to compete in the league 5 weeks ago: https://www.the42.ie/treaty-united-42-read-5383097-Mar2021/.

That's how long they've had to train, how long the team has had to gel and how much work they've been able to do. No superstars have arrived, not even a player who really catches the eye. 

They've competed in 3 friendlies in preseason, drawing 2 and winning a third. You may be thinking this isn't too bad of a record, however the first of the draws came against Premier division side Waterford (who are tipped to be relegated and are in a similar disarray with a messy transfer window and poor signings). 

The second draw, and 2-1 win came against an Athlone town (First Division) side who did even look to be trying. Athlone were lethargic on the ball, didn't even seem to want it back when they were out of possession, yet the best chances given to and taken by Treaty were given to them on a plate by an Athlone side that would've rather not showed up.

To top it off, towards the end of the second Athlone game the fitness levels of the Treaty players was exposed. All the goals came in the first half and the last 20-30 minutes of the game looked more of a walking kick about than a preseason preparation match.

Bray Wanderers to beat Treaty United: expect Treaty to fly out the box early and put pressure on, but have faith in a fitter, more professional and defensively sound Bray team to absorb it, turn the tide and cruise to victory.",,1616920528,banterpanther19,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

For England, there is gonna be players like Kane, Mount, James, Chillwell and dozen of more. In last match England played against poor San Marino and won only 5-0, while Armenia played against Andorrra and won only 1-0, poor performances for both teams, but today, England is going to crush them.

Gonna keep it simple for this one. Pegula and Pliskova played each other twice in the last month, both matches on hardcourt. And both time Pegula won with ease. 6-0/6-2 and then 6-1/6-3. Pegula is a nightmare matchup for Pliskova because she can really abuse her lack of mobility. She's also an excellent returner which takes away Pliskova main weapon - her serve.

I also had high hopes for Endpoint, but facing such individually strong team as Liquid is too hard task for them. Now they're facing not one of the best players to ever touch CS, but also a very structured one. There is literally no way for Endpoint to win the match, yet I don't see them winning a map.

This is also a very easy one to predict, at least I think so. Evil Geniuses looked great in the opener against Astralis, but it was just way too many things going in their favour. We could see them struggling against fnatic yesterday which shouldn't be happening. Their map pool really sucks, especially when it's their first tournament with oBo. On the other hand, Liquid is looking really sharp, especially individually. I feel like they are currently a step ahead of EG in every way. I recommend betting on **Liquid ML @ 1.70 3u (MEDIUM)**

UCLA vs Alabama **Over 144 (1u)**

Going with the rare 2 picks today. This won't happen too often, but I am fairly confident in both. Alabama has both the size and shooting to easily takedown this small UCLA team. The Pac-12 has been red hot both SU and ATS in the tournament but that will come to an end here against a very good Tide team. While Alabama is not likely to drop 95+ as they did against a Terps team with above average defense, they should get the job done comfortably. Bama should be able to secure the W with good opportunities on the offensive glass, consistent 3 shooting, and enough playmaking to get good ball movement leading to open looks.

Regarding the Over, UCLA averages 69.9 PPG whereas Bama averages 75. Based on their averages alone, it totals to exactly 1 point over the Over/Under. With that being said, I do not anticipate this game to be close for the most part, expect more second half points than first half points.

My mans Stipe was eating multiple shots and the night-night left hook after thinking he could counter. Francis stiffened the takedown attempt in round 1 and returned some shots. He was very patient and did not rush in after every shot. Congrats to Francis Ngannou and he definitely improved from last time.

**Sport:** Tennis

**League:** ATP

**Date/Time:** 3/28/21 9:20 AM PDT

**Event:** Jannik Sinner vs Karen Khachanov

**\*\*Pick: Total O22.5 (-120)\*\***

**Wager:** 2u

**Reason:**

These two players are very even in skill level and are 1-1 H2H. Sinner took the most recent head to head matchup in early February 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(4) while Khachanov came back down 2 sets to win in 5 at US Open 2020. Khachanov is an agressive baseliner that will try to win easy points off his serve while Sinner is more of a counterpuncher with an all around game. Sinner reminds me of Andy Murray 2010-2012 with a steady game. As you can see from the previous scores, they were very close and could have gone either way. Even if someone wins 7-6, 6-4, the bet would cash. Expect at least 1 tie breaker.

BOL! Fade me though!

##LOCK OF THE EPOCH

Take FSU ML (+120). Fuck the points, we don't need them. 

I guarantee this will hit, and it will hit easily. I'm talking FSU by 7 to 10 points if not more.

Reasons why this is the EPOCH LOCK:

- FSU has height at every position.

- Hunter Dickinson is soft. Seriously, he is. He's going to get bodied. FSU is **BEST** in the country at limiting FG% right at or under the basket (47%).

- Michigan allows way too many three-point shot attempts. That's fine for your average three-point shooting team, but FSU is 15th in the nation at 3P%.

- FSU on the other hand *does not* allow very many three-point shot attempts; their defense is designed to funnel more to the inside... where they *swat your shit* at the 11th best rate in the country.

- Michigan sucks at getting breakaway steals. FSU is really good at getting them.

- Little midget Mike Smith (5'11"") is running the point for Michigan. That's cute but he's going to be absolutely *bodied* by MJ Walker (6'5"") from FSU.

- FSU swallows up offensive boards. Gray, Koprivica, and Barnes really fight for good position and they actually box mf'ers out.

- The Michigan defense simply does not force enough turnovers to stop this FSU offense. Michigan allows opponents to get off too many shots.

- FSU likes to drive and/or pound it inside and get off close shots. This is their highest offensive tendency. Michigan sucks against teams that pound it inside. Look at Illinois on March 2nd. They lost by 23. Illinois pounds it inside too. Look at Michigan's game about a week ago against Texas Southern. Of course they won, it was a -25 spread, but they under-performed (didn't cover by 9 points) against a terrible team that prefers inside shots too.

- FSU 3-point defense has been elite. Look at their past 3: Colorado went 6/25, UNCG went 7/27, Georgia Tech went 5/23. Michigan had to go 10/25 from deep to beat LSU, and that is not happening here. When Michigan shot closer to 30%, they lost most recently to Ohio State. As mentioned before, FSU doesn't give great 3-point looks anyway.

I'm putting all my liquid assets on FSU ML, then liquidating everything I own and putting that on FSU ML as well.

Oral Roberts played almost exactly as I predicted yesterday taking advantage of a high paced game and giving Arkansas all the fight they could up until the very last shot. May they rest in peace. Shooting for some more money tomorrow 

The Hawks and the Nuggets square off tomorrow and the game feels like it‚Äôs sitting low to me at 226.5. The last three times these two have played they‚Äôve met a higher total than this. The Nuggets are 4th in PPG this season while the Hawks sit comfortably at 14th. They‚Äôre sitting at 19th and 20th in defensive rating putting them in the bottom half of the league. The Hawks in their last game scored 124 on a top ten defense in the league in golden state. I expect them to ride that momentum in to next game. Neither team plays at a particularly high pace but with both teams having a plethora of players that can score at will, great offensive efficiency ratings, and mediocre defense at best.

Your looking at a player who's price has dropped to under $9K (DK) for the first time in a month (12 games), a player who is averaging ~35 minutes a game with 30% usage who is going into a neutral defensive matchup (Tatum's a good defender, but I watch the C's every night and he's still sluggish and isn't passing the eye test as a shutdown defensive player right now). 

I'm not saying Kawhi was the best play on the board, but he was far from a ""goofy"" lineup selection. I'm not sore, I didn't play him last night (I'm $1 in Tiers for NBA to get DK's ironman crowns and that's it for the rest of the season) but there's no other reason for this post than to lord your superiority over the rest of us.

77,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;I'm trying to work out my system there. If you have any tips, I'm all ears.

Haha, for tips you might be better served listening to winning players. For showdowns I'm essentially treading water this year (and that's largely thanks to treading down a contest with a field of ~2300 in last weekend's NYR/WAS game), but...

Generally speaking, this year I've been running 5-1 stacks in most of my showdowns. Captaining a forward and then trying to jam in his full line plus a pp d-man for corellation. Trying to include a goaltender gets me to five. Then I'll just see what I can afford for the single. In some cases, if I foresee a low event game, I'll try and jam in both goaltenders.

It's a very feast/famine strategy, over the last seven days I've cashed in 9/23 showdown entries (ranging from $0.25 to $5 contests), if your line hits you're in good shape. If not, move on to tomorrow. One thing I'm not afraid to do in a hockey showdown is to leave money on the table in amounts I wouldn't consider in other sports. 

I absolutely wouldn't do things this way in cash contests (weirdly I prefer cash in every sport EXCEPT hockey, just can't get cash right in this sport).",,1614382730,georgethethirteenth,nhl_draftkings_showdown_lineup_build_for_bruins

In general, I do like to have some correlation. At least players that either play on the same line or same power play unit. I usually like to try to get three top-six forwards (two from same line, one from other line) that all play on the top power-play unit when I can. McAvoy fits that in this slate with a weaker BOS 2nd line, but I would consider Ritchie as well.

If you prefer consistency, stick with 75/25 splits (rough est) cash/gpp. You can go more 50/50 if you want a greater emphasis on GPPs. Stick with smaller field, higher stakes entries. Don't fall prey to the lotteries like the millies or the $1/$2 50k+ fields.",,1614346896,_Royalty_,betting_strategy

Because experts are using models for the plays they are pushing which eventually becomes chalk, optimal lineups usually contain chalk. Is that what you mean by it being a math thing?

Your LaVine/Kat play was definitely contrarian as Walker, SGA, and Allen were the major chalk in those positions last night. Walker was over 50% owned and SGA and Allen were around 35%. However, your play was also mathematically good because you had strong correlation by having the 2 alpha dogs on opposing teams where both teams play horrible defense.

I have dabbled in years passed, but this year I wanted to try and be more serious about it.  Getting into the 150 entry tournaments is just not my thing.  Cash games and single entry is where I live now.  AND, to stay on topic, it's largely because of the optimizer.  I can't seem to get it to work the way I want.

I know that the optimizer is essentially a math equation solver, but I must be doing something wrong (eliminating too many players from the pool, asking for too much variance, something...).",,1614270486,TheSlyHog,optimizer_constraints_and_nba_dfs
24,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;Maybe my lineups are too safe. Idk.

At this point I'm only NBA to hit the ironman on DK, but I'd wager this is a large part of it.

If you're entering GPPs with safer lineups then stick to SE contests. Yeah, it's fun to play for the $100K, but your chalkier stuff is going to be far more likely to turn a profit chasing the $1-2K prizes in SE. If you can't afford to throw 150 into the Clutch Shot - or just don't want to go through the effort of making 150 lineups - then I would stay away.

I'm going to disagree with the comment above that said ""If you are always 1 or 2 points away, then you are actually a much better player than most"". It may, or may not, be true, but remember that most players are losers over time and being better than most is *probably* just means you are losing at a slower pace.

If your lineups are consistently hovering around the min cash line then you need to take a look at your roster construction (or contest selection). Fact is, the payout for minimum cash is only 1.5-2X and even if you feel like you're hitting it consistently there's a strong likelihood that over time you won't get there often enough to turn a profit over the course of the season.

If you want play the big GPPs, I don't think you can be happy with a minimum cash. Sure, it's better than a loss, but if you're constructing your lineups with that in mind then you're never going to produce one that finishes at the top. For GPPs you need to study the top lineups each night and start your own construction with an aim to finish in the top 3% or so - and even that's only 2.5X in the FanDuel Clutch Shot - and to understand that this means you're going to have lineups finishing in the bottom 3% just as often as at the top. These contests are SO top heavy in payout structure that the only way to finish in the black over time is going to be to hit one or more top 50 finishes over the course of a season...and a ""safe"" lineup rarely does that.",,1614270334,georgethethirteenth,does_anyone_know_the_math_about_why_we

33,dfsports,"Okay, I hear you. You want some math?
On a 10 game (20 teams) NFL slate, there are Approximately: 
20 QB's to choose from
40 RB's to choose from
60 WR's to choose from
20 TE's to choose from
120 Flex players to choose from
and 20 D/ST's to choose from

What I'm saying is this. Ownership matters, but not always necessarily a physical ownership percentage number. If you've been playing long enough and learned enough about the game of DFS, you'll learn how to assume a player/team's ownership in your head because of the matchup, pricing, range of outcomes. You're going to tell me you can guess which players I'm going to choose from if we went H2H? In the milli-maker,  Yes, ownership absolutely matters because the odds of somebody already building that combination of players are far greater than the odds of only 1 of 100 entries building that same combination. 

If you're looking for the math actual math equation to calculate ownership, I can't tell you because I don't know. But I also dont care because I already know in my head who is likely going to be highly owned. And if you think you'll build that exact same combination as me in a 100 entry (or even 1000 entry) contest as me, good luck :)

Just don't get too hung up over it, you know what I mean? You're gonna win some, you're gonna lose some. But you don't need to win them all. You just need that 1 big win. And if you invest wisely, you'll earn a steady ROI over time regardless of whether you try to be different with projections and ownership. That's all.

I normally only play NFL, which is primarily in Q4, but I‚Äôve read / heard that the IRS may expect quarterly taxes based on DK winnings, especially when they‚Äôre large. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre consistently winning over separate quarters or not but I would recommend researching that.

That being said as long as you don‚Äôt net ~ -$11,500 for the rest of the year you should expect a 1099 from DK come the end of January 2022.",,1614195284,PantherFan1824,so_i_won_12000_on_draftkings_last_night_now_what

42,dfsports,"Well as far as TJD goes, I don‚Äôt love the price but the matchup is good. Fact is Rutgers ranks towards the bottom in the country in interior defense. Myles Johnson or no Myles Johnson, it seems he must not be a great defender even though he can rack up blocks. 

Wong is interesting to me. I can find no reason for why his minutes dipped so drastically. So yeah we do get him cheaper than he‚Äôs been all season, but that is a lot of risk to take on in that price range. I think your better off rostering someone like John petty or Moses moody in that price range. 

And I do actually like some Marquette players, but there are some question marks there too. Dawson Garcia‚Äôs minutes have been trending down even though in the last game he went out briefly due to injury. It seems like in the last game too koby Mcewan‚Äôs minutes dipped a lot too, and guys like Greg Elliot and Symir Torrence played more. I think Carton is a good play, Cain is overpriced, Garcia is a fine play but you‚Äôre taking on more risk with him, John is an okay play, and I wish we could play Mcewan at that nice price, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think his minutes are guaranteed.",,1614192620,punkfiend443,college_hoops_dfs_picks_wednesday_224

Personally, I think the DK ranking system is severely flawed. If they want to KEEP the new users, they need to not let them get targeted so easily by the sharks. I get it, there's no rules against it, but keep letting it happen and you can kiss your growth potential goodbye.

If you want to dive into the deep end and play large field GPP's, go ahead, and let it be a battle royal. That's the only exception. But every other contest needs to be ranked based on experience, and I'm not talking about a stupid ""Badge""... I'm talking about ranking a user based on their Average fantasy points per contest-entered and their win/loss ratio per contest-size.

48,dfsports,"Mostly due to how dominator points are distributed. The super speedways (Daytona/Talladega) are typically less laps and its spread out in terms of who leads laps and fastest laps, plus there is usually a huge wreck which shakes things up. The road courses are longer tracks with less laps, again meaning that laps led/fastest lap points aren't as important.  

Most of the 1.5mile and short tracks usually have a couple dominant cars that lead a really good chunk of the race, and it's usually one of the top tier drivers starting near the front. In these races, the lower tier teams are just that, they fall back pretty quickly.

Just to give you an idea, you get 1 point for a Par, 3 Points for a Birdie and 5 points for an Eagle, while losing nothing for Bogeys of any kind.  They would NOT allow me to pick all LESS than 24.5.  I had already deposited the funds.  I contacted them.  They did NOT give me an answer as to why I was not allowed to pick all LESS.  I also played a 2 player contest, in which I tried to go LESS on both.  Once again, I was not allowed.  They already had my money.  So, I gave in, and had to pick players to go MORE.

Of course there are plenty of people who do use default setting and just press the optimize button.
