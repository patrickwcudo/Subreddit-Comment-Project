I think its pretty easy to see why this pick is must. Capela going against Jokic, one of the worst defenders in the league. Denver takes over 21 points on average over C, while Capela scored 22 points last game against him. I expect 16-17 points and no blowout.

..which is a really stupid thing to do, you are literally donating money to the bookies. Both because they give terrible return rates on square long shots, *and* because they take a 2nd cut when you place the hedge bets. 

If your intention is to hedge after 3 wins, you should do the following instead: Take the exact amount you spent on the long shot and place it on Houston ML, and when you win, you take all the winnings and spend it on Houston ML for the next match, and then the same once more. You'd be in the exact same situation as you are now post-hedge, except you'd have a lot more because the return rates on standard odds are higher, and because you wouldn't need to place any hedge bets.

OR you can just keep doing what you're doing, it's your money. I'm just talking from a mathematical standpoint; you're literally donating money to the bookies by playing long shots with the preemptive intention to hedge halfway through.",,1616960969,Away-Mobile7993,houston_4500_future_hedging_advice

Pick: **Portland Trail Blazers -1.5 (-110) vs Toronto Raptors NBA @ 4:00PM PST

Persuasion: The Blazers are a more complete and potent offense. With Damian Lillard returning to the lineup the Raptors really don’t have the guard play to handle Lillard, McCollum, Powell, and Covington. To add to that Nurkic is also returning to the lineup. Revenge game for Powell for trading him so I see this as a statement game for the Blazers to want to rally around that energy. It should be a close game but we know Dame Time is the side you want to be on",,1616959485,Frazierfuture,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

This hinges on Blackwood being in goal for New Jersey. He has a 2-0-1 record against the Bruins this year. In those game only 5 goals were allowed on 92 shots. In the other goal, Rask is still out leaving duties up to Halak. He has been starting a lot more than expected this year and might be running out of gas.

POTD Record 3-0

Last Pick: Raps/Suns over 54.5 1Q

Analysis’s have been spot on.

History

1. Raptors -1.5 (+131 or 2.3) ✅
2. Kings -5 (+130 or 2.3) ✅ 
3. Raps/Suns over 54.5 ✅

POTD: Raptors/Portland Under 230.5

Analysis: Raptors have picked up defensively and are clicking everywhere. I expect them to upset a lot of people in the upcoming weeks as the team finds their defensive identity once again. They held the Suns to 104 Points as they held Booker to 6/14 shooting while only scoring 16 with 4 turnovers. 

Lilliard is expected tonight but has been having a bad stretch due to a finger injury that continues to still bother him.

 Portland has been shooting red hot from 3, 44% on this road trip. I expect reality to kick in as all of them besides CJ are in the 30-38%.",,1616955689,nsanesian,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

**----&gt; CBJ 3-way Regulation (-110, 1.5U)** \- If Greiss starts, I like Columbus to bounce back today. Greiss is easily one of the worst goalies in the league and Columbus has dropped a few in a row now. Going back to this play and hopefully it pays out today.

694,54,sportsbook,"252-247-6 -15.46u  yesterday: 2-4  this is what happens when you pick against Oregon State

**Creighton +13.5 vs. Gonzaga**  pretty much the number I had it at..guess I'll take the points. Creighton is a very skilled offense that can keep up if they play their best, which is a big if given they were inconsistent all season, but still. and they had their best defense in a long time. High potential for backdoor cover here as well. 

**Florida State +2.5 vs Michigan** should be a really tight one..I think FSU has to be pretty happy with how its defense played in the NCAAT so far given it wasn't that good in the regular season at times. Turnovers have been the Seminoles biggest problem but Michigan's defense is in the 330s in turnover rate, and if FSU can get out and run they will be a matchup problem. 

**UCLA +6.5 vs. Alabama** Who am I to say the Pac-12 won't keep up it's nearly perfect record ATS. With two scorers playing as well as Juzang and Jaquez are right now they certainly can keep up offensively. If bama shoots 3s like they did against Maryland it's over but been a little inconsistent in that regard the past six weeks. 

**USC -2 vs Oregon** Was a big matchup problem for Oregon in the regular season meeting. Dana Altman will make some adjustments and it will be closer, but overcoming Evan Mobley inside and USC's rebounding and ability to get to the free throw line for an undersized team will be tough. I said the same against Iowa and was way off, but USC's defense is obviously on a much different level. 

**Louisiana Tech +1.5 vs. Colorado State** Nothing much on this one but just for fun..teams at the same level for me but LT's defense should be the best unit on the floor.",,1616952847,SeattleDegenerate21,ncaabb_daily_discussion_32821_sunday

I just wanna keep playin without having to reload too often, and maybe will get lucky

My strategy has been to go heavy, like 100% ownership on 2-3 fighters that I think are the best plays on the slate

Went 100% on Menifield and Ngannou.  Menifield cause the discount price and high early finish potential, and Ngannou, cause the dude is a just a comically large human being.  And had 66% on Maverick cause she's impressed me so far, so I did alright.

The real bummer though, was didn't have any of Marc Andre Beralut, so my chance of winning was over after first fight... the absolute worst feeling lol

Granted it requires you being much more intentional about your lineup construction but I think it adds more value to doing a ton of research or using optimizers/projection tools. It also prevents you from having to worry about over-exposure to your core because you should only be playing one lineup. With cash though I would lean towards projections rather than gut because with such condensed ownership you can’t really afford to get away from chalk when some guys are clearly much more optimal than others each slate.

I went ahead and played him in a handful of lineups and was thankful I did. But I also played too much Bradley and suffered because of it.

There's always going to be some randomness, which is why the person at the top of the GPPs every night usually has someone who was 5% or less owned.

Tonight a bunch of Houston guys should pop. Porter Jr without Wall and Oladipo, sign me up. I have a hard time believing that Wood is going to play, and if he does, how much is he going to play, so I'll avoid him. I will probably go back to Martin Jr at PF because he should get minutes in garbage time, so should Porter Jr. 

On Rotogrinders I believe Court IQ is still free. You can remove all the injured/traded players and it'll show you how many minutes they've played without those guys on the court, how much their production goes up, what their usage is like and useful info like that. For example, if you Remove Bam off, Jimmy Buckets goes to like 1.58 points a minute. And if you look further you can see he get something like a .19 fantasy boost per minute (I think that's what the bottom section is for).

I knew the risks going in, but, he's playing minutes and minutes = points (in theory). He also only shot 2-9 so the volume was there and if he was making his shot, say, like 7-9, he would have got somewhere in the 20's pointwise. I can live with that although it's not great.

I use Rotogrinders and for me it does help. I really get rid of the players I don't want it makes the lineup optomizer pretty good.

969,9,dfsports,"&gt; And when I say knowledge, I mean from a fan perspective not a DFS perspective

I'm gonna disagree with this - just slightly.

NBA DFS has, to some extent, been solved. If you haven't got the 'right' projections (whether they're your own or paid for) then I wouldn't bother playing NBA at this point. You don't need DFS knowledge *or* basketball knowledge for this part. You need the numbers and you need just a little bit of analytical knowledge - with the right numbers it's almost plug and play, but not quite.

Basketball knowledge does help in the ~90 minutes leading up to lock. Injury news, late scratches, etc - you need to know not only who's getting newly freed up minutes, but how those personnel combos are going to affect the play on the floor. If you know that, then you can gain an edge over those players who are simply plug-and-playing based on the numbers...*but* if you don't have those numbers yourself you're going to be sunk in the long term.

It's no fun for the actual basketball fan and I'm sorry to say it, but AI, algorithms, and our robot overlords have won the NBA DFS war. If you want to win, join them.",,1615900505,georgethethirteenth,how_do_i_get_better_at_nba_dfs

All 3 centers I gave have different skill sets where DvP doesn't really help at all.

Let's say vucevic was going up against Embiid and the 76ers. Most players would shy away from vucevic but I would actually take vucevic cause his usage is high. My only fear is foul trouble but that comes with the territory.",,1615786799,spgh0st90,revolutionary_nba_dfs_tool_ive_been_working_on

1138,18,dfsports,"Ughh man... if you only knew how bad inwang to jump on this. Unfortunately I work full time with a 1 year old, and the only time off I have from work is the winter season (which doesn't help at all if there's no baseball). I've become very much involved with baseball Analytics and the mechanics of hitters/pitchers, understanding what the different metrics and stats mean and how they're calculated.. I spent the last 3 months developing a pretty sophisticated workbook (atleast in my opinion) full of hitter &amp; pitcher projections for the season using a combination of 7 different expert projections and weighing them with historical performances (based on 2 years, 1st &amp; 2nd half of season, rookie vs veteran development from season to season for the different age groups, ..etc) ...


I doubt I qualify for this opportunity simply because of my busy schedule, but I'd really like to get in touch and see how I could be of some help in maybe providing the workbook I've put together ? Maybe it's something that could be of use to you? And I'm not looking for anything (payments), I just want your opinions on what I've done and get some insight or feedback if possible?

1392,32,dfsports,"I bet primarily through Rivers Illinois and bet sports/play dfs professionally. The rivers casino terms and conditions / rules actually don’t explicitly state anything about a maximum payout. But I thought you might find the below interesting, a walkthrough of how to use their “really high payout parlay generator”. 

https://helpcenter.il.betrivers.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048560474-What-is-the-Jackpot-Parlay-Feature-


 I can however tell you that from my own personal experience, that limit sits around $250,000. If I wanted to place a bet with a payout higher than $250,000 I would have to send it to a trader at the casino for manual approval but have never once had a problem getting it accepted within a couple minutes. 

While William hill may have a (disgustingly low) payout limit, I really don’t think you understand how that would even work. No that does not mean if you concocted a parlay with William hill that would payout at +10000000000000 and put $1 on it that they would accept the bet, and if it hit go, “oh tough shit our Max payout is 720-1, here’s $720 take it or leave it.”, they wouldn’t let you place it in the first place, they’d tell you sorry this exceeds our payout limit we can’t take this bet. If a legal casino accepts a bet at stated odds then they have accepted the bet.",,1615305470,George_H_W_Kush,look_at_this_crazy_parlay_lol
1393,33,dfsports,"You are wrong and you’re not making any convincing argument. They would pay this out without a fight unless OP had some illicit or suspicious activity on his account. It would get flagged to a trader and they would greenlight it, then get on Teams to marketing so they are aware. I’ve worked in bookmaker Head Offices, I know how these things work. If someone gets lucky and wins big off fuck all stake, you market the shit out of them. They’ve probably paid out on parlays with bigger payouts than $90k in the last year. I know someone who won $20k off a 20-leg parlay with a **free bet** and he got his money as soon as the last leg landed.

I don’t make these kind of bets so you won’t see me on here, and if I did win $90k then I certainly wouldn’t be posting it on Reddit.",,1615304660,AdministrativeLaugh2,look_at_this_crazy_parlay_lol

1396,36,dfsports,"I am not new to this. I am not saying $90k exceeds their payout limit I am saying that the odds on that bet exceed anything they would reasonably pay. As I pointed out William Hill caps max parlay payout odds at +72000, that is a long way off +34415887. While Draftkings does not explicitly state a cutoff they do state in their terms:

&gt; These Rules are applicable to all transactions with DraftKings Sportsbook and may be supplemented at any time in DraftKings’ sole discretion. In the event that any of these Rules conflict with the Terms, the Terms shall govern.

&gt; In cases where it deems that these Rules are inconclusive, DraftKings reserves the right, according to its own discretion, to settle offers on an individual basis on the basis of equity, attaining itself to generally accepted betting norms, customs and definitions.

And just for laughs I took a look at the notoriously player unfriendly Barstool Sportsbook's house rules where no max amounts, payouts, or odds are listed:

&gt;As mentioned in these House Rules, the Operator reserves the right to limit the net payout (the payout after the stake has been deducted) on any bet or combination of bets, by one Account Holder or any group of Customers/Account Holders acting together.


I agree with you that when you consider the PR/marketing perspective it would probably be in their interest to pay a bet like this. The issue for a bettor would be getting enough attention to make it worth it for them. 

What I am saying is that they would not do this without a fight. They could easily point to how their rules don't conclusively address the issue and cite industry norms such as William Hills rules or god forbid BSS.

Obviously I am not going to change your mind on this so I hope that down the road you prove me wrong and reply to this with an insane slip. And if they fight you on it I will gladly go to battle in Rovell's mentions for you to get it the necessary attention.",,1615304162,papercutjake,look_at_this_crazy_parlay_lol

If they were an offshore sportsbook then sure, they probably would, but they’re DraftKings. You’re not actually providing me with any reasons as to why they wouldn’t pay it out. They have no history of not paying out.

$90k is literally nothing to them and parlays like this hitting is essentially free publicity. It would be a PR disaster if they just said “Nah we’re not paying you out cause it was only a 26c wager and our vague rules say we don’t have to.” Everyone would just migrate over to FanDuel or another book.

here is what is considered a top book, William Hill's house [rules](https://www.williamhill.us/house-rules/). Second table states max ML parlay payout at ""720-1 rounded to the nearest nickel"".

That paragraph is irrelevant as it is to do with the initial stake, not the payout. You’re kidding yourself if you think a legal sportsbook would refuse to pay this out. 

They would absolutely love a parlay like this to land occasionally. They can market the shit out of it and bring in 10x or 100x more on people trying the same thing and all losing.",,1615299972,AdministrativeLaugh2,look_at_this_crazy_parlay_lol

19- I wasn't playing as much because of schooling, but managed to have a small profit of around $5,000 from 3 different tournament cashes and then a $4,000 win in Nascar.

20- I was in the process of becoming an NFL scout so I was staying away from it for much of my time but managed to play a few small single-game slates and hit for $4,000 return that season

21- I finally gave it a full swing of things and followed some great minds and came away with $85,000 profit this year off a $55,000 tournament win and a $27,000 win and continued some great success. with some 3,000 profit here and there but lost a good amount in the playoffs and week 15-16.",,1615242637,TapeNeverLied,inside_the_dfs_mind

1523,3,dfsports,"No. This is not commentary on who I think will win the fight I am just trying to make the point that you should never bet the house on anyone. Whatever you were willing to bet I would bet 5% of. Betting too high of a percentage of your bankroll can bankrupt pretty much any strategy long term.

For example, Sportsbooks are currently giving Medic about a 63% of winning the fight. Let's say you evaluate the fight and correctly say he has a 73% of winning the fight. Giving you a 10% edge over the sportsbooks (Which is really really good).

If you start with $100 bankroll, your bets have a 10% edge, and lets say you don't bet 100% of your bankroll each bet but you bet 50% instead. If you made 1000 bets with this criteria you would finish with more than the $100 you initially had about 33 out of 100 times.

But... If you start with $100 bankroll, your bets have a 10% edge, and you bet 5% of your bankroll each bet. If you made 1000 bets with this criteria instead you would finish with more than the $100 you initially had about 100 out of 100 times. 

You also not only have a much smaller chance of losing money but the total amount made is higher with the 5% betting strategy as well.",,1614876463,Huge-Bulge,should_i_bet_the_house_on_uros_medic

Last Pick Analysis: Didn't have time to watch this game but Denver really pulled off a great second half and narrowly pulled it off. Great win with risking 2 units. On to the next!

Sport: NBA
Time: 7:00 PM EST
Pick: Portland @ Toronto 1H Total OVER 119 @ +115 (2u)

I know I said I'm holding off on totals for a bit, but these are two teams that are bottom 5 in defensive rating over the last 10 games (Portland last and Raptors #26). Toronto is also number 7 in pace over that timeframe, and while the Blazers aren't one of the faster paced teams, they have a positive over percentage at 55.6% (same for the Raptors) so I'm not too worried. 
What really sold me about this line is the fact that the Blazers average first half total is a whopping 122.2 in their last 5 games, while the Raptors are at 114. Keep in mind that the average defensive rating of the teams Toronto has faced in that span is 110.4, while Portland's is 116.8. Theoretically, if Toronto played those games against the Blazers' defense, their average 1H point total would be 120.6. For what it's worth, using this same formula the Blazers' 1H total would be 121.66. For the sake of simplicity I'm averaging this out and rounding down to 121. Is this a valid model to find a predicted line? Who knows, probably not, but it's obvious that they're gonna go over 119. Feel free to adjust the line if you like.

As always, bet at your own risk and....

The last time I posted was on 3/3/21 and came out with a win and before OT. I believe with Raptors being at home and a day of rest they should come out shooting. Blazers should be able to keep pace. Blazers are ranked 27th out of 30 for pts allowed. Raptors are ranked 24th offensively it's the only thing that scares me.

NYR @ WAS. CAPS ML -132. Under -114.

I feel very good about Washington at home.  With Samsonov in goal, I feel confident this won't be a high scoring game. 

ANA @ STL. STL -1.5. +116.

# SaveOneBet Over Performing Lines Info

*Tables will be updated during the day as all lines and odds are not all out yet on Pinnacle.*

This post is just to show some interesting stats from the previous games, **THESE ARE NOT PLACED BETS**. To see more statistics and interesting picks check my website ([SaveOneBet](https://www.saveonebet.com/))

Over Odd, Under Odd and lines are from Pinnacle and correspond to actual line and odds of player prop for next game. The games (game-1, etc) correspond to last games played by the player along with its stats.

\---------------------------------------------------

# Top 10 best % Over/Under last 5 games

*Ordered list of pick by best percentage of over/under vs. actual line over the 5 last games*

*Ex: if over the last 5 games the player is always 5/5 under OR over the actual line he will be at the top of the list. On the opposite if the player is 2/5 or 3/5 under OR over he will be at the bottom.*

Last pick: EG ML vs Fnatic@1.68 (lost)  


Unlucky bet last time, EG threw some extremaly dumb rounds and lost the decider map because of it. Today we are betting on them again tho.  


**EG map1** vs Liquid@2.05 2U (19:00 CET)  
EG is picking first map in this match and I am pretty confident they will pick Inferno - clearly their best map. So far, this event, on Inferno they won vs Astralis and Fnatic, lost in overtime vs VP. Wins vs Astralis (probably still #1 in the world) and fnatic were clean, while vs VP they lost after tough battle.   
Liquid played this map only once in EPL - won vs Endpoint (16-12), not the best team out there, they should have won and did it. Additional factor thats super important here - EG have to win this match to still have a chance to qualify to playoffs, so we shouldn't be worried about their motivation. Last time these teams faced off in January and Liquid won 2-0, including 16-12 on Inferno, but EG changed their roster (for better) since then. Good luck!

Dickinson: 25.7 MPG, 14.2 PPG, 7 RPG, 60.8 FG% 76 FT%

Wright: 34.6 MPG, 15.2 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 51.3 FG%, 65.1 FT%

So in 10 more minutes per game, Wright gets one extra point and rebound over Dickinson while scoring much less efficiently at 51 v 60 FG%. Dickinson also has better talent surrounding him and has to share PPG/RPG with NBA talents in Wagner, Livers, and Brown.

Had some bad picks yesterday. Pick it back up today.

Chris Paul U1.5 threes.  Hasnt hit more than 1 in the last 8 games. I’ll stay with this one til it burns me.  

Kyle Kuzma O3.5 assists.  After getting burned by him in the 0 assist game a few days ago, i’m putting my hand back in.  

Devonte Graham U5.5 assists.  Again, burned by him last game, but willing to go back in.  He isn’t a big assist guy, even with Lamelo being out in previous games.
Michael Porter Jr. O24.5 Pts+Rebs.  I’m a little reluctant on this one.  With the addition of Aaron Gordon, not sure what the Nuggets line up will look like and how Porters minutes, touches, and rebounds will be affected.

**Murray/Soares** vs Evans/Skupski: *Jamie and Bruno playing some very good tennis since reuniting, should be a fun match with lots of net play but the big boys will clean up here*

**Felix Auger Aliassime** vs John Isner: *the American vet continues to grind out matches on the tour, but I believe Felix has made sufficient improvements to nullify the aging servebot*

**Eise Mertens** vs Annet Kontaveit: *cant stand watching her play, but Elise has quietly become a fixture in the business end of tournaments. A human backboard. She’s won the last two h2h, and is only losing to gigantic hitters lately. As easy for me as WTA gets (famous last words?)* 

**Jessie Pegula** vs Karolina Pliskova: *two players trending in opposite directions. Jessie has wrecked her twice already this year— too much of a mental summit for Pliskova to climb today. Smash city*

**Emil Ruusuvuori** vs Mikael Ymer: *battle of the Nordics! Ymer has a big game that could pose trouble, but overall Emil has a much deeper toolbox to employ in this matchup. Least confident of the five, but still really like it.*

Day 28

Back with more picks for the remaining sweet 16 games. A great day yesterday finishing up 4.84 units, let’s try and keep it going today!

47-38

\+13.09

**Creighton 1H ML +320 (1 unit)**

I mentioned yesterday we could see slow starts from favorites because of the unusual format of this year’s tournament, and it certainly worked out in my favor. I’ll go to that well one more time with Creighton here. They’re a very good team with a volume scorer and are getting a huge number to lead at halftime. We all know Gonzaga can turn it on and end up covering this game in a span of five minutes, so I’m hoping for a game script similar to their win over BYU a few weeks ago.

**Michigan -2 (1 unit)**

After avoiding Michigan games altogether since the Livers injury, I guess they’re going to survive long enough to force my hand. I’ve loved watching this team play all year and will end up laying the small number. Michigan shoots lights out from the free throw line, and has enough outside shooting to win this game. I’m worried about turnovers and foul trouble for Dickinson, but I’ll take talent over depth and size in this one.

**Alabama -7 (2 units)**

With the best defense left in the tournament and an insanely high volume offense, this has got to be the most dangerous team remaining. Add to that UCLA has not played good defense of late despite having a defensive minded coach. Even if UCLA can hang in there for a half, I don’t see them keeping Bama from eventually making a lot of threes. I’d be willing to lay up to 8 or 9 here, so I’ll put an extra unit on the 7. 

**Oregon ML +110 (1 unit)**

My favorite game of the day, this PAC 12 rematch should live up to the hype. Oregon is certainly going to have trouble scoring like they did against Iowa, but I don’t think they are going to need to. I expect a close hard fought game here that will come down to the final few minutes. Oregon’s guards shoot much better from the line than USC and won’t turn the ball over as much, so I’ll let those be my tiebreakers and take the ducks on the ML.",,1616936354,chalktalkbets,ncaabb_daily_discussion_32821_sunday

NCAA Basketball: Gonzaga vs Creighton (2:10pm)

Creighton's coach said in an interview if ya cant beat Gonzaga ya have to join them.  Implying they have to come out shooting and not do what other teams have done.

Zags are 1st in pts per possesion and Creighton is 40th.  This should be a shootout.  Creighton will have to play near perfect, hit their 3s and have solid games from their starters to win this/stay close. I think they jack up 3s to keep pace and hope its close the last 5 min and try to get the win. 

Gonzaga will get 85 to 90 pts.  The question is if Creighton can score in the 70s?  I think they will so the over is my play.

&amp;#x200B;

**Last Pick:** NBA - \*\***CHI Bulls ML** vs SA Spurs **(2.3@5u)**

**Last Pick Analysis:** Actual game line is CHI+3.5. DECENT RISK - BE CAREFUL as always. I like it until CHI -5.5. The Spurs are looking to break their 4G L-streak here, while the Bulls are looking to get back at the Spurs for the 4Q beating they took in their previous matchup. CHI was leading by as much as 20 points, only to lose late in the 4Q. CHI got rid of WCJ and the veteran Otto, but got Vooch in return. Today will be Vooch's first game, and he'll definitely be looking to shine, playing alongside Lavine. Poeltl isn't a match for Vooch, so the Spurs will definitely need to send double teams every now and then in the low post, forcing Vooch to kickout to the nearest shooter. I think the Bulls dynamic will change here, probably averaging more 3pt attempts than usual (usually 30 attempts - looking at around 39ish) because of Vooch's arrival. Expecting White, Lauri and Lavine to all have higher 3pt makes due to better looks. Also important to note that (in a 10 game sample size), CHI is ranked 7th in backcourt defensive efficiency, and 2nd in 3pt defensive efficiency (backcourt too). Another point I like is that the maestro Thad Young will likely lead the 2nd unit with White, and though White isn't great, I consider it decent firepower against the very thin SAS bench. My only worry is Vooch's slow &amp; lackluster defense might be exploited by Coach Pop. However, I'm still expecting CHI to completely dominate this game, and win 126-111 (Higher than their usual scoring).

&gt;**Last Pick Afterthoughts:** OK FOUR 5U LOSSES IN A ROW THIS IS FRUSTRATING. Bulls took a lot of 3s, BUT NEVER HIT THEM. THEY SHOT 8 of 34 3s. How horrendous. Entire team played like how we expected, getting good looks beyond the arc, but just not hitting them. That is just sad. Young seems slightly lost in his new role, and the entire team just gave up so many TOs in the first half alone. They finally picked up and started catching up in the 4Q, but it was already too late. Way too difficult to overcome a 36pt lead in the 3Q. Vooch played with 0 heart. His offense is really good, but man,  does he have the defensive IQ of a rock or what. Coach Pop really did exploit this by running double cutters and backscreened runners into Vooch and just confusing him like a lost guppy. Plus the man just plays with zero heart. I hate that. SAS won 120-104. Apologies boys.

ON TO THE NEXT, Degens!

**POTD**\*\*: click-&gt; &gt;!NBA - \*\* ALT LINE TOR Raptors -5 vs POR Tblazers (2.56@5u)  !&lt;

&gt;!Analysis: Actual game line is TOR-1.5. BIG RISK - BE CAREFUL as always. I like it until TOR -8.5. I'm going with TOR again here. Putting my faith in statistics above emotion. TOR lost big for us in a 5u b2b, but this time I feel they're back. TOR has exceptional 3pt backcourt defensive efficiency, currently 6th in the league (recent 10 game sample size), while POR is ranked 2nd from the bottom. For frontcourt, POR ranks last in the league in 3pt defensive efficiency (same 10 game sample size). TOR loves to put up 3s almost as much as UTA does, and should have a sizeable lead because of this. TOR is also first in the league in team forced TOs when OG is playing, vs POR's bottom 10th ranking. Expecting the main TOR squad to go wild here, hopefully shooting lights out from beyond the arc. Also looking for a big game from Gary Trent Jr against his former team, with 6+ 3s. Norm will be norm, but I'm expecting OG to be his usual disruptive self, and contain POR overall. OG is pretty much the key to TOR winning in any given night. Siakam has also been playing angry in the past few, trying to prove a point to Coach Nick Nurse, and I'm expecting him to be the same All Star in this one. Expecting around 20 of 47 attempts to drop from beyond the arc for TOR here. Hopefully Dame Time is flustered tonight. Looking at TOR to win here 127-114. I really don't want to go under 50u profit here. We NEED this win Raps!!!!&lt;

Kosovo has already impressed us with their significant improvement over the past few years. The coach Bernard Challandes is responsible for the rise of Kosovo. The Swiss managed to build a strong team that plays beautiful possessive football. The stars of the teams Vedat Muriqui, Milot Rashica, Amir Rrahmani, Mergim Vojvoda, Arber Zeneli will be the main thread for the Swedish defence.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has already returned to the national selection of Sweden after a 5-year break. The impact of Ibra was vivid after only a few minutes as he made a marvellous assist for the 1-0 win over Georgia. Today the Swedish will be determined to take another 3 points and get closer to World Cup Finals in Qatar.

Kosovo is known for their attacking style and today they will do all it takes to score a goal at least. Considering the supremacy of Sweden, the team is expected to score either. Seeing goals on both nets is very likely to happen.

Alabama Vs UCLA 7:15pm EST
Play: Alabama -6

Don’t look now but Mick Cronin has UCLA playing some fantastic basketball right now. A team that was plagued by inconsistency throughout the season has reeled off 3 straight as an 11 seed. They had wins over Michigan State and BYU which on paper looked like good wins. However, I think both teams were overrated and BYU could not buy a 3 in that game. Their win over Abilene Christian really isn’t anything to write home about either. This will be their first real test of the tournament and it comes against an Alabama team under one of the best coaches in the country. The Crimson Tide just Rolled right over the Maryland Terps, a very good defensive team, and hit 16 three pointers on the way to a 19 point victory. A big thing here is that guard Joshua Primo was back from injury and looked healthy. They were missing him in the Iona game and it showed. This is a team that can run almost any team in the country out of the gym on any given night. UCLA is 212th in the country at defending the 3 and that is really going to hurt them in this matchup. On the flip side Bama is one of the better defenses UCLA has faced all season and this game just doesn’t feel like it will be close. I’ll take Bama with the points and I think they probably win by double digits here. 


Lastly, I had a few people request it so I’ll just post it here.

**POTD: UCLA +7 vs. Alabama @ 1.95 (-105)** \[NCAAB\] - 01:15 CET

**Ducky’s Breakdown:**

UCLA is just a solid team across the board. They are 15th in offensive efficiency, scoring 113 points in every 100 possessions. They are 66th in defensive efficiency, allowing only 94 pts in every 100 possessions. UCLA is also 13th in the nation at 3p%, shooting 38.9%, as well as 19th in FG%, shooting 48%. They are just an efficient and well run team. They face a very tough test in Alabama this weekend as they are one of the best teams in the tournament.

As you can see here, there aren’t many advantages for either side. Any advantage that Alabama has, UCLA pretty much matches or is slightly behind them. There are two that stick out: Consistency and Pace.

UCLA is one of the more consistent teams in the tournament. They are methodical and you always know what you’ll get from them- efficiency. Alabama, on the other hand, is erratic but talented as hell. You never know which Alabama team you will get - the one who’s going to kill you, or the weird one with the tail between its legs.

Pace is the other major difference here. This is a battle between the tortoise and the heir. UCLA being the tortoise (337th in pace) and Alabama being the heir (19th in pace). This is actually an advantage for UCLA, in my opinion, as if they’re able to slow Alabama to their pace it will make Bama uncomfortable and cause them to make more mistakes.

Some fun stats:

* When facing teams that have an offensive near-proximity FG% less than 63.5%, UCLA performs better than the norm 64% of the time. Alabama’s near-proximity FG% is 58%.
* When facing teams that have a second-chance potential point rate greater than 12.6, UCLA is more efficient than normal 50% of the time. Alabama has a second-chance potential point rate or 17.34.

Final Thoughts:

This should be a close game at the end. Ultimately, I think Alabama squeaks out a win, but UCLA will put up a fight. I also would not be surprised if they outright win the game. All we need is UCLA to not lose by more than 6 points and I think that happens here.

**Fooxied’s Breakdown:**

Most of my friendly cappers and also the public money is on the side of Alabama and even before the bracket, I would also bet on them, but recent games have shown their weaknesses.

Since beating Michigan State in the First Four, the Bruins have been on a roll and one of the main reasons is the play of great guard Johnny Juzang, who is averaging 22.3 ppg in the last 3 games. The Bruin defense was fantastic against the ACU shooters in the 67-47 win, the team was excellent from the start offensively and the rebounding has been there.

Alabama shoots a whole lot of threes, but UCLA has been okay against the Pac-12 teams. It’s a better shooting team from the outside and it’s going to roll on the free throw line. The Tide limited the fouls in the 96-77 win over Maryland, but it’s usually putting teams on the line at least ten times and UCLA should pounce. The Bruins are a whole lot stronger from the line than they showed against Abilene Christian.

Both teams have shot the ball well from 3-point range in the tournament. UCLA is 24 of 56 (42.9 percent) in three games. Alabama is 21 of 47 (44.7%) in two games. Both teams also have defended the 3-point line well. The Crimson Tide's opponents are 15 of 50 (30 percent) in those two games, and the Bruins' opponents are 13 of 51 (25.5 percent). Alabama is 11-1 SU in the last 12 games, but 6-6 ATS in those. UCLA was shaky before bracket, but since then they are 3-0 ATS in bracket games, all wins with a significant advantage of points.

Underdogs are doing extremely well in the tournament, most games are really close. As I mentioned, I would bet on Alabama before the bracket, but the recent games of both teams show quite different trends. I didn't think UCLA would make it that far, I don't think they can win this game, but the spread Vegas is offering us has some good value. I think it should be closer to 4.5 which is why I think UCLA is a good choice here.

Today's Pick: Washington Capitals ML  vs New York Rangers (Under 6.5 Goals -125)

&amp;#x200B;

The Capitals come into today's matchup as one of the hottest teams in the league. They are 12-6 on home ice, while the Rangers are 8-9 away. The Capitals are 12-2 when they are the favored team in a game. The Capitals have really been playing a much better defensive game lately, with the majority of their losses coming in the very beginning of the season. In the Month of March their games have gone 8-4 for the Under 6.5 goals

The New York Rangers come in to todays game on less than 24 hours of rest and it's an away game for them. Typically when we see a game like this it favors the under. When you have a little less jump in your step you like to dump the puck in a lot or flip it out of your zone which I think we'll see a lot of today. 

These teams are 4-0 on unders for the season averaging just 4.5 goals in those games. The Rangers have been one of, if not the best, teams in the league at defending the Capitals allowing just 1.5 goals per game in their 4 matchups so far.

I went back and forth a bit between the under 6.5 or the Capitals ML. I'm putting my $$ on the under because there's always that one team that just matches up and plays against a better team and finds a way to win. I expect this to be a 3-2 game with pretty tight play and not a ton of scoring opportunities.",,1616931169,ghost3737,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

You just simply can't expect these guys to have a strong urge to win every single regular season game. The Hawks can definitley pull one off. They could also get trounced. I don't even know who their playing and I say that.",,1616929240,mrRabbitNBK,nba_daily_discussion_32821_sunday

558,78,sportsbook,"Record: 2-0-0, tennis was good to me paat 2 days, however with the match i had in mind for today got pushed to probably even after next thread is opened, switching up to basketball as my next pick. Playing progression (Aiming between 1.5 - 2 odds until 3 wins, then start over with my entry bet / 1/10 of total bank).


Previous pick: Fucsovic M. - Kokkinakis T; Fucsovic to win 1.7 W


Todays pick: Basketball | ABA Liga | 11:00 EST

KK Zadar - KK Igokea Aleksandrovac; Igokea - 4.5, odd 1.65



Igokea, positioned 3rd on the table, is visiting Zadar, sitting at 11th place. Igokea is definitely playing one of the best basketball in the league, and it's a no surprise they're ranked 3rd. That, and the fact last game they played was 5 days ago (trip to Tenerife, champions league match, lost 75-80, though the game was close up to the 4th quarter) makes me believe they'll have no issues covering this number.


Zadar on the other hand is playing sporadically throughout the season - They're winning games in local Croatia league, but losing in ABA League almost consistently (Last 6 games, only 1 win vs 10th placed Borac by 2 points at home). However, unlike Igokea, last game they played was yesterday, where they won on away trip to Zabok. Coach of Zadar even said that the schedule's been tough on them, and that they will enter this match completely unprepared due to the time between these 2 games. 


Last match they played H2H was in December last year, Igokea being the host - they sweeped Zadar 72-48.



With all that being said, Igokea winning by 5 points or more is my go to bet for today. In case your book doesn't have this spread, i would probably go up to - 6.5 points and still feel safe about the pick.

the big 10 has shown their true colors this tournament, (as a ridiculously overrated conference), and are still without their star player, isaiah livers.

michigan has looked very unconvincing in their first 2 games in the tournament, beating texas southern by 16 and LSU by 8...having to score in the 80s each game to do so. they will not be able to do score that much against FSU. michigan’s size won’t be much of an advantage today considering fsu is a bigger team. 

florida state has been playing lockdown defense all tourney, only allowing opponent’s to shoot 33.6% from the field.  they also are extremely efficient on offense (ranked #15 in kenpoms offensive efficiency ratings).

**NIT**

**Memphis -4** The Tigers have been rolling through teams-**10-2 in their last 12**.   Their only losses were at Houston by 3 and a ridiculous shot at the buzzer and by 2 to the Cougars in the AAC Tournament.  

That's the same Houston team that killed Syracuse last night and is now on the brink of the Final Four. 

**NCAA**

**Gonzaga first half spread and game** \- Much like Baylor against Villanova-Gonzaga is just a better team. 

Not to mention, Creighton has also been less than spectacular lately.

They **lost to Georgetown by 25 in the Big East tournament** and beat UC Santa Barbara by just one on the first round of the Big Dance.💃 

The **Bluejays are also one of the worst free throw shooting teams in the country** which should allow the Zags to keep picking up points until eventually they're up 15. 

**Alabama -5.5** \- That Pac-12 has definitely represented but the Bruins are simply outgunned here athletically. 

The big difference should be the three point line where **Alabama has allowed its opponents to shoot just 28.9% for the season.** 

That's **eighth best in the country.**

That's it for now. 

I will research a few other games and post on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/CoolhandClint7)**-**as well as any in game live picks that I like.

612,52,sportsbook,"#  Romania vs Germany

The home side had a successful start to the campaign after picking all three points against Northern Macedonia. Romania celebrated a 3:2 victory, but they almost spilled two points despite a 2:0 lead. Ianis Hagi and the lads enjoy a good run since they failed to win only once on the previous four occasions. However, we won’t be seeing them in EURO since Romania missed both chances to qualify for the final tournament. They finished 4th in the group and also missed the opportunity to secure playoffs in the UEFA Nations League. Mirel Radoi’s side has been pretty efficient lately, especially when playing at home. In the last three games at Arena Nationala, Romania scored eleven goals. The hosts look forward to putting another good display to pick at least a point from this match.

Germany also met the expectations in their opening match in these qualifiers by beating Iceland 3:0. Joachim Low’s side is the strongest favorite in this group, and the visitors want to secure the top spot. They had a very successful campaign in the EURO quals, where they booked seven wins in eight games. However, a heavy 6:0 defeat against Spain in the UEFA Nations League prevented them from challenging that trophy. Ilkay Gundogan and the lads perfectly opened the clash against Iceland by scoring two goals in the first 7 minutes. It was their second game to keep the clean sheet from the previous ten occasions. Germany wants to show dominance in this group and will search for a victory in Bucharest

Full-Time Winner Odds &amp; Prediction

Despite Romania’s excellent recent form, Germany is a firm favorite to win this clash. We believe they will meet the expectations and celebrate by two goals at least.

Goals Market Prediction

Their head-to-head clashes have always been a joy to watch. None of the sides managed to keep the clean sheet in their four encounters, and just one match stayed under a 2.5 margin. We expect to see at least three goals in total in this game.

**Germany AH -1.5 @ 1.85**

**Over 2.5 FT @ 1.55**

**Correct score 1:3 @ 11.00**",,1616920691,bat-bet,soccer_daily_discussion_32821_sunday
613,53,sportsbook,"#  Bulgaria vs Italy

Bulgaria had a poor start in the World Cup Quals after losing against Switzerland at home. They lost the game already in the locker room, as Switzerland had a 3:0 lead after just 12 minutes into the game. Yasen Petrov’s side managed only to score a consolation goal at the beginning of the second half. The hosts failed to qualify for EURO as well since they picked only six points in their group. Bulgaria also got relegated from the UEFA Nations League Division B, where they remained undefeated only twice. Kiril Despodov and the lads celebrated only once on the previous ten games, and that victory came in a friendly match against Gibraltar. The home side needs to improve a lot to win something from this game.

Italy had a confident start to the campaign after beating Northern Ireland 2:0 at home. Domenico Berardi and Ciro Immobile scored before the halftime break, and after that, everything was a routine. The visitors are the top favorites for winning 1st place in the group, but Switzerland will search for its chance. Roberto Mancini’s side has been pretty convincing lately as Italy hasn’t lost its previous 23 games in all competition. They were perfect in the EURO Quals after winning the group with all ten victories. Azzurri will also have the chance to challenge the UEFA Nations League trophy, as they qualified for the final tournament. Leonardo Bonucci and the lads have been almost unbeatable in the back, as they conceded just once on the previous eight occasions. The visitors want to keep up where they left off and celebrate another important victory.

Full-Time Winner Odds &amp; Prediction

Italy is a strong favorite in this match, and everything except the away side’s win would be a surprise. The visitors should secure the advantage already in the first half.

Goals Market Prediction

Bulgaria has severe troubles converting its chances into goals, while Italy is excellent in the back. Therefore, we think the away side might keep the clean sheet for the fifth time in a row.

**Italy HT-FT @ 1.65**

**BTTS No @ 1.55**

614,54,sportsbook,"Pick: Bray Wanderers (1.67) v Treaty United

Sport: Soccer

Competition: League of Ireland First Division

Bray Wanderers competed in the First Division last year, the second highest tier of Irish soccer, and came a single point shy of automatic promotion. They had the best defensive record in the league, conceding 13 goals in a truncated due to Covid season. When playing at home, they conceded 3 in 9 games.

This year, they're not the favourites to win promotion due to the quality of the teams relegated from the Premier Division last season, ie Cork City and Shelbourne. However, Bray are a legitimate First Division side, with pedigree in the competition and should certainly be considered the 'best of the rest', with the only real competition for third place coming in the form of Galway United.

Treaty United were granted a license to compete in the league 5 weeks ago: https://www.the42.ie/treaty-united-42-read-5383097-Mar2021/.

That's how long they've had to train, how long the team has had to gel and how much work they've been able to do. No superstars have arrived, not even a player who really catches the eye. 

They've competed in 3 friendlies in preseason, drawing 2 and winning a third. You may be thinking this isn't too bad of a record, however the first of the draws came against Premier division side Waterford (who are tipped to be relegated and are in a similar disarray with a messy transfer window and poor signings). 

The second draw, and 2-1 win came against an Athlone town (First Division) side who did even look to be trying. Athlone were lethargic on the ball, didn't even seem to want it back when they were out of possession, yet the best chances given to and taken by Treaty were given to them on a plate by an Athlone side that would've rather not showed up.

To top it off, towards the end of the second Athlone game the fitness levels of the Treaty players was exposed. All the goals came in the first half and the last 20-30 minutes of the game looked more of a walking kick about than a preseason preparation match.

Bray Wanderers to beat Treaty United: expect Treaty to fly out the box early and put pressure on, but have faith in a fitter, more professional and defensively sound Bray team to absorb it, turn the tide and cruise to victory.",,1616920528,banterpanther19,pick_of_the_day_32821_sunday

We are going hot boys. So many beautiful odds hit and today we are gonna add another one. England's team looks super promising and Albania is just way below them. For England, there is gonna be players like Kane, Mount, James, Chillwell and dozen of more. In last match England played against poor San Marino and won only 5-0, while Armenia played against Andorrra and won only 1-0, poor performances for both teams, but today, England is going to crush them.

There were many moments when VP could have walked away with the win, but the Danes didn't let them to make it happen. I also had high hopes for Endpoint, but facing such individually strong team as Liquid is too hard task for them. Now they're facing not one of the best players to ever touch CS, but also a very structured one. There is literally no way for Endpoint to win the match, yet I don't see them winning a map.

&gt;**Evil Geniuses vs Liquid**

This is also a very easy one to predict, at least I think so. Evil Geniuses looked great in the opener against Astralis, but it was just way too many things going in their favour. We could see them struggling against fnatic yesterday which shouldn't be happening. Their map pool really sucks, especially when it's their first tournament with oBo. On the other hand, Liquid is looking really sharp, especially individually. I feel like they are currently a step ahead of EG in every way. I recommend betting on **Liquid ML @ 1.70 3u (MEDIUM)**

Going with the rare 2 picks today. This won't happen too often, but I am fairly confident in both. Alabama has both the size and shooting to easily takedown this small UCLA team. The Pac-12 has been red hot both SU and ATS in the tournament but that will come to an end here against a very good Tide team. While Alabama is not likely to drop 95+ as they did against a Terps team with above average defense, they should get the job done comfortably. Bama should be able to secure the W with good opportunities on the offensive glass, consistent 3 shooting, and enough playmaking to get good ball movement leading to open looks.

Regarding the Over, UCLA averages 69.9 PPG whereas Bama averages 75. Based on their averages alone, it totals to exactly 1 point over the Over/Under. With that being said, I do not anticipate this game to be close for the most part, expect more second half points than first half points. It might seem relatively slow to start out with but both teams should get going fairly fast once they find their groove.

**Sport:** Tennis

**League:** ATP

**Date/Time:** 3/28/21 9:20 AM PDT

**Event:** Jannik Sinner vs Karen Khachanov

**\*\*Pick: Total O22.5 (-120)\*\***

**Wager:** 2u

**Reason:**

These two players are very even in skill level and are 1-1 H2H. Sinner took the most recent head to head matchup in early February 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(4) while Khachanov came back down 2 sets to win in 5 at US Open 2020. Khachanov is an agressive baseliner that will try to win easy points off his serve while Sinner is more of a counterpuncher with an all around game. Sinner reminds me of Andy Murray 2010-2012 with a steady game. As you can see from the previous scores, they were very close and could have gone either way. Even if someone wins 7-6, 6-4, the bet would cash. Expect at least 1 tie breaker.

##LOCK OF THE EPOCH

Take FSU ML (+120). Fuck the points, we don't need them. 

I guarantee this will hit, and it will hit easily. I'm talking FSU by 7 to 10 points if not more.

Reasons why this is the EPOCH LOCK:

- FSU has height at every position.

- Hunter Dickinson is soft. Seriously, he is. He's going to get bodied. FSU is **BEST** in the country at limiting FG% right at or under the basket (47%).

- Michigan allows way too many three-point shot attempts. That's fine for your average three-point shooting team, but FSU is 15th in the nation at 3P%.

- FSU on the other hand *does not* allow very many three-point shot attempts; their defense is designed to funnel more to the inside... where they *swat your shit* at the 11th best rate in the country.

- Michigan sucks at getting breakaway steals. FSU is really good at getting them.

- Little midget Mike Smith (5'11"") is running the point for Michigan. That's cute but he's going to be absolutely *bodied* by MJ Walker (6'5"") from FSU.

- FSU swallows up offensive boards. Gray, Koprivica, and Barnes really fight for good position and they actually box mf'ers out.

- The Michigan defense simply does not force enough turnovers to stop this FSU offense. Michigan allows opponents to get off too many shots.

- FSU likes to drive and/or pound it inside and get off close shots. This is their highest offensive tendency. Michigan sucks against teams that pound it inside. Look at Illinois on March 2nd. They lost by 23. Illinois pounds it inside too. Look at Michigan's game about a week ago against Texas Southern. Of course they won, it was a -25 spread, but they under-performed (didn't cover by 9 points) against a terrible team that prefers inside shots too.

- FSU 3-point defense has been elite. Look at their past 3: Colorado went 6/25, UNCG went 7/27, Georgia Tech went 5/23. Michigan had to go 10/25 from deep to beat LSU, and that is not happening here. When Michigan shot closer to 30%, they lost most recently to Ohio State. As mentioned before, FSU doesn't give great 3-point looks anyway.

I'm putting all my liquid assets on FSU ML, then liquidating everything I own and putting that on FSU ML as well.

Last Pick: Oral Roberts +11 W

Oral Roberts played almost exactly as I predicted yesterday taking advantage of a high paced game and giving Arkansas all the fight they could up until the very last shot. May they rest in peace. Shooting for some more money tomorrow 

The Hawks and the Nuggets square off tomorrow and the game feels like it’s sitting low to me at 226.5. The last three times these two have played they’ve met a higher total than this. The Nuggets are 4th in PPG this season while the Hawks sit comfortably at 14th. They’re sitting at 19th and 20th in defensive rating putting them in the bottom half of the league. The Hawks in their last game scored 124 on a top ten defense in the league in golden state. I expect them to ride that momentum in to next game. Neither team plays at a particularly high pace but with both teams having a plethora of players that can score at will, great offensive efficiency ratings, and mediocre defense at best.

Your looking at a player who's price has dropped to under $9K (DK) for the first time in a month (12 games), a player who is averaging ~35 minutes a game with 30% usage who is going into a neutral defensive matchup (Tatum's a good defender, but I watch the C's every night and he's still sluggish and isn't passing the eye test as a shutdown defensive player right now). 

I'm not saying Kawhi was the best play on the board, but he was far from a ""goofy"" lineup selection. I'm not sore, I didn't play him last night (I'm $1 in Tiers for NBA to get DK's ironman crowns and that's it for the rest of the season) but there's no other reason for this post than to lord your superiority over the rest of us.

957,77,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;I'm trying to work out my system there. If you have any tips, I'm all ears.

Haha, for tips you might be better served listening to winning players. For showdowns I'm essentially treading water this year (and that's largely thanks to treading down a contest with a field of ~2300 in last weekend's NYR/WAS game), but...

Generally speaking, this year I've been running 5-1 stacks in most of my showdowns. Captaining a forward and then trying to jam in his full line plus a pp d-man for corellation. Trying to include a goaltender gets me to five. Then I'll just see what I can afford for the single. In some cases, if I foresee a low event game, I'll try and jam in both goaltenders.

It's a very feast/famine strategy, over the last seven days I've cashed in 9/23 showdown entries (ranging from $0.25 to $5 contests), if your line hits you're in good shape. If not, move on to tomorrow. One thing I'm not afraid to do in a hockey showdown is to leave money on the table in amounts I wouldn't consider in other sports. 

I absolutely wouldn't do things this way in cash contests (weirdly I prefer cash in every sport EXCEPT hockey, just can't get cash right in this sport).",,1614382730,georgethethirteenth,nhl_draftkings_showdown_lineup_build_for_bruins

In general, I do like to have some correlation. At least players that either play on the same line or same power play unit. I usually like to try to get three top-six forwards (two from same line, one from other line) that all play on the top power-play unit when I can. McAvoy fits that in this slate with a weaker BOS 2nd line, but I would consider Ritchie as well.

If it's to make an income, you need a much larger bankroll. So next question is how do you want to build that bankroll - via one huge hit on a GPP or consistently, over time. There isn't a wrong answer, just a preference.

If you prefer consistency, stick with 75/25 splits (rough est) cash/gpp. You can go more 50/50 if you want a greater emphasis on GPPs. Stick with smaller field, higher stakes entries. Don't fall prey to the lotteries like the millies or the $1/$2 50k+ fields.",,1614346896,_Royalty_,betting_strategy

Your LaVine/Kat play was definitely contrarian as Walker, SGA, and Allen were the major chalk in those positions last night. Walker was over 50% owned and SGA and Allen were around 35%. However, your play was also mathematically good because you had strong correlation by having the 2 alpha dogs on opposing teams where both teams play horrible defense.

I have dabbled in years passed, but this year I wanted to try and be more serious about it.  Getting into the 150 entry tournaments is just not my thing.  Cash games and single entry is where I live now.  AND, to stay on topic, it's largely because of the optimizer.  I can't seem to get it to work the way I want.

I know that the optimizer is essentially a math equation solver, but I must be doing something wrong (eliminating too many players from the pool, asking for too much variance, something...).",,1614270486,TheSlyHog,optimizer_constraints_and_nba_dfs
1064,24,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;Maybe my lineups are too safe. Idk.

At this point I'm only NBA to hit the ironman on DK, but I'd wager this is a large part of it.

If you're entering GPPs with safer lineups then stick to SE contests. Yeah, it's fun to play for the $100K, but your chalkier stuff is going to be far more likely to turn a profit chasing the $1-2K prizes in SE. If you can't afford to throw 150 into the Clutch Shot - or just don't want to go through the effort of making 150 lineups - then I would stay away.

I'm going to disagree with the comment above that said ""If you are always 1 or 2 points away, then you are actually a much better player than most"". It may, or may not, be true, but remember that most players are losers over time and being better than most is *probably* just means you are losing at a slower pace.

If your lineups are consistently hovering around the min cash line then you need to take a look at your roster construction (or contest selection). Fact is, the payout for minimum cash is only 1.5-2X and even if you feel like you're hitting it consistently there's a strong likelihood that over time you won't get there often enough to turn a profit over the course of the season.

If you want play the big GPPs, I don't think you can be happy with a minimum cash. Sure, it's better than a loss, but if you're constructing your lineups with that in mind then you're never going to produce one that finishes at the top. For GPPs you need to study the top lineups each night and start your own construction with an aim to finish in the top 3% or so - and even that's only 2.5X in the FanDuel Clutch Shot - and to understand that this means you're going to have lineups finishing in the bottom 3% just as often as at the top. These contests are SO top heavy in payout structure that the only way to finish in the black over time is going to be to hit one or more top 50 finishes over the course of a season...and a ""safe"" lineup rarely does that.",,1614270334,georgethethirteenth,does_anyone_know_the_math_about_why_we

1072,32,dfsports,Not that. The showdown captain mode for individual games. Where you select 6 players with $50k and one of the players will be captain who will cost 1.5x original price and score 1.5x points.,,1614256387,gauthamramp,free_optimizer
1073,33,dfsports,"Okay, I hear you. You want some math?
On a 10 game (20 teams) NFL slate, there are Approximately: 
20 QB's to choose from
40 RB's to choose from
60 WR's to choose from
20 TE's to choose from
120 Flex players to choose from
and 20 D/ST's to choose from

What I'm saying is this. Ownership matters, but not always necessarily a physical ownership percentage number. If you've been playing long enough and learned enough about the game of DFS, you'll learn how to assume a player/team's ownership in your head because of the matchup, pricing, range of outcomes. You're going to tell me you can guess which players I'm going to choose from if we went H2H? In the milli-maker,  Yes, ownership absolutely matters because the odds of somebody already building that combination of players are far greater than the odds of only 1 of 100 entries building that same combination. 

If you're looking for the math actual math equation to calculate ownership, I can't tell you because I don't know. But I also dont care because I already know in my head who is likely going to be highly owned. And if you think you'll build that exact same combination as me in a 100 entry (or even 1000 entry) contest as me, good luck :)

Just don't get too hung up over it, you know what I mean? You're gonna win some, you're gonna lose some. But you don't need to win them all. You just need that 1 big win. And if you invest wisely, you'll earn a steady ROI over time regardless of whether you try to be different with projections and ownership. That's all.

Hope that helps?",,1614252314,Bam607,does_anyone_know_the_math_about_why_we

I normally only play NFL, which is primarily in Q4, but I’ve read / heard that the IRS may expect quarterly taxes based on DK winnings, especially when they’re large. I don’t know if that’s if you’re consistently winning over separate quarters or not but I would recommend researching that.

That being said as long as you don’t net ~ -$11,500 for the rest of the year you should expect a 1099 from DK come the end of January 2022.",,1614195284,PantherFan1824,so_i_won_12000_on_draftkings_last_night_now_what

1162,42,dfsports,"Well as far as TJD goes, I don’t love the price but the matchup is good. Fact is Rutgers ranks towards the bottom in the country in interior defense. Myles Johnson or no Myles Johnson, it seems he must not be a great defender even though he can rack up blocks. 

Wong is interesting to me. I can find no reason for why his minutes dipped so drastically. So yeah we do get him cheaper than he’s been all season, but that is a lot of risk to take on in that price range. I think your better off rostering someone like John petty or Moses moody in that price range. 

And I do actually like some Marquette players, but there are some question marks there too. Dawson Garcia’s minutes have been trending down even though in the last game he went out briefly due to injury. It seems like in the last game too koby Mcewan’s minutes dipped a lot too, and guys like Greg Elliot and Symir Torrence played more. I think Carton is a good play, Cain is overpriced, Garcia is a fine play but you’re taking on more risk with him, John is an okay play, and I wish we could play Mcewan at that nice price, but unfortunately I don’t think his minutes are guaranteed.",,1614192620,punkfiend443,college_hoops_dfs_picks_wednesday_224

Personally, I think the DK ranking system is severely flawed. If they want to KEEP the new users, they need to not let them get targeted so easily by the sharks. I get it, there's no rules against it, but keep letting it happen and you can kiss your growth potential goodbye.

If you want to dive into the deep end and play large field GPP's, go ahead, and let it be a battle royal. That's the only exception. But every other contest needs to be ranked based on experience, and I'm not talking about a stupid ""Badge""... I'm talking about ranking a user based on their Average fantasy points per contest-entered and their win/loss ratio per contest-size.

The super speedways (Daytona/Talladega) are typically less laps and its spread out in terms of who leads laps and fastest laps, plus there is usually a huge wreck which shakes things up. The road courses are longer tracks with less laps, again meaning that laps led/fastest lap points aren't as important.  

Most of the 1.5mile and short tracks usually have a couple dominant cars that lead a really good chunk of the race, and it's usually one of the top tier drivers starting near the front. In these races, the lower tier teams are just that, they fall back pretty quickly.

Just to give you an idea, you get 1 point for a Par, 3 Points for a Birdie and 5 points for an Eagle, while losing nothing for Bogeys of any kind.  They would NOT allow me to pick all LESS than 24.5.  I had already deposited the funds.  I contacted them.  They did NOT give me an answer as to why I was not allowed to pick all LESS.  I also played a 2 player contest, in which I tried to go LESS on both.  Once again, I was not allowed.  They already had my money.  So, I gave in, and had to pick players to go MORE.  I was in contact with them throughout the day.  I deposited $450.  I lost $250 on College Basketball, and $100 on each Golf Match.  I should have won $2200 and $300.

I'm not using the optimizer to provide me with a single ""optimal"" lineup, but in the case of MME I am using the tools available within the optimizer. 

Of course there are plenty of people who do use default setting and just press the optimize button.

Hey all, I've been working on a simulation model on and off for the past few years that basically uses Monte Carlo simulations to simulate games to find out the most likely outcomes. It's been on a good run recently, so I figured I'd share the results with you guys.

**FAQ:**

**What is the methodology used?**

Mainly a mix of advanced rate stats, standard deviations, positional defense, and some manual adjustments to simulate each game. It also relies heavily on the minutes projections posted by Numberfire for their daily projections.

**What exactly are you predicting?**

I run 100 simulations, and calculate the average final score from all the results. I also track what percentage of the simulations beat the spread/total, to give a little more context on how confident the simulation is in the result.

**Why should I trust you?**

You really shouldn't.

**I completely disagree with your pick, and you're a moron for making it.**

Probably.

**Yesterday's Slate (3/27/21)**

|Home|Away|Spread|Total|Prediction|% home covering|% over|Fina;|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|WAS|DET|\-3.5|225.5|106-109|26%|28%|106-92|

^(\* Means that the projected minutes don't add up to a full game)

* Great day on the totals though.

**Sunday Slate -** A friendly 4 game slate that we should be able to do a deep dive on. Apologies for the late, and limited review on Saturday, and we certainly struggled on the small unit plays (which is ok, they were low confidence), but made some back on the 2u plays. 

Night-Before Meme Parlay (&gt;+500) - Hawks ML + Suns ML + Magic ML (1u, +1206)

Initial Leans - Good luck to all! 

Suns at Hornets - **Hornets +6.5, U219.5 (1u)** \- Both teams can play defense (Hornets in lower scoring games lately, and scoring less since LaMelo went down) and this is a matinee, leading me to this under. I think the Suns are a more complete right now and should be able to win the game but Charlotte is playing well and could keep it close at home. I like the under enough to bet it right now and will revisit the game tomorrow.

Blazers at Raptors - Great revenge spot for teams that just made a relatively large trade. My initial read is the Raptors will be 1 or 2 point favorites and I like them to win comfortably tomorrow without any further information. I'd also lean on an under probably to around 225. We will see where the line opens and the injury reports. 

Hawks at Nuggets - **Hawks +4.5, U226.5** \- I think the Nuggets are going to be sluggish coming home from a road trip and may get caught off guard by the Hawks, who continue to impress me when their offense isn't just Trae Young heaving 3s, and they've been much better on defense. 

Magic at Lakers - **Magic +7, O208** \- This is an avoid/low confidence game, but the new Magic showed some life vs Portland, despite the crazy spread, and I'm not sure this Lakers team deserves this kind of number vs any NBA team. 

**Year to Date Slate Record** \- 529-472 (**+35.3u)**

**Weekly Slate Profit** \- **+2.5u**

**Weekly Overall Profit (My Bets) - +27.4u**

**Tuesday's Record (w-p-l)**: Slate 7-11 (**-.7u)** Overall Night (**+2.1u)** \- Some of those games were just garbage or injured teams facing off with what I felt were weird handicaps, so I'm glad that is over with. For what it is worth, we killed it on ncaab and the discord seems locked in on those lines, which is nice for those like me who focus nba.

So this event I tried to be more measured in my approach, and my first bet was Oleksiejczuk-Bukauskas does not go the distance. Almost every post and analysis I read/watched predicted either fighter getting a KO-victory. Lost €1000,- to start the night.

Then I managed to make €500 betting on Menifield, and another €630,- by betting O'Malley-Almeida does not go the distance. I already started getting upset after O'Malley didn't finish the fight in the 1st round when he had the chance, but like a miracle he still managed to TKO Almeida.

Then I made another €407,- on the Ngannou-Miocic fight (including a €37 live bet on Ngannou haha).

This is a tough day to forecast good odds on but I’m leaning toward taking VP 2-1 (+180). Fnatic will prob ban D2 and pick Train which I think will be close and Fnatic might be able to sneak in a win. But VP has been so strong and Fnatic has a shallow pool so VP should be taking this series. 

While Astralis have definitely looked vulnerable this week I think they’ve stabilized well with back to back with a over liquid and VP.

184,24,sportsbook," NHL PICK FOR MARCH 28  


The Jets and Hurricanes gave us back to back wins – lets continue this momentum with another underdog play today! (Sorry, I somehow missed the post yesterday on this site, but had Carolina listed as my POTD on my Twitter)  


RECORD:  
Bets won = 8  
Bets lost = 9  
Profit = +2.49 units (from RISKING 1 unit per play)  


Today's pick of the day (odds from Bet99 at 12:20 am Eastern Time):  


**NY Rangers vs Washington (-130)**  


This pick is based on ""The Snapped Winning Streak"" betting system, which goes as follows:  
Bet AGAINST a team whose winning streak of length 3+ was just snapped in their previous game. Make the bet only if the team you are betting has a money line that's better than -150 (i.e. 1.667 in decimal).  
This strategy, over many seasons, produced a 87.34-unit gain on 1045 bets (a 8.4% ROI).  


The Rangers had their winning streak snapped on Saturday against the Flyers so we’ll be going with the Capitals on Sunday!

Last Pick Afterthoughts: The game got out to a slow start and never fully bounced back to where it needed to be to hit the over. The ending had me hopeful that it would hit OT to push the scoring over the edge, but oh well. Arkansas really shot poorly (so props to them for pulling it off), but I was expecting a lot more scoring.

**3/28/21**

**Pick of the Day**: NCAAB – #11 UCLA vs. **#2 ALABAMA -6.5** (-110)

Going back to a spread bet for today’s pick. Alabama looked like a legit Final Four team in their last game and we’ve seen that they can muscle out a win when their shots aren’t falling and DOMINATE a win when they are. I think UCLA’s hot streak comes to an end against this tough Alabama team. The Tide has won 11 of their last 12, play great defense, and have many guys who can kill you from deep. Alabama has covered 4 of the last 5 times they were given a single-digit spread. UCLA hasn’t seen a team like Alabama in this tournament yet, so I’m big on the Crimson Tide.

Last 5 Picks:

Knicks ML (-139) W✅

Hawks ML (-143) L❌

Knicks ML (-157) W✅

Suns ML (-165) W✅

Wizards ML (-137) W✅

POTD: Nuggets ML (-185)

Reason: Aside from that very ugly third quarter, the Wizards put together a very dominant game just as I predicted. For the limited minutes Beal had, he put together a very stellar performance, and Westbrook had a second consecutive game with 18 rebounds.

With the Nuggets newly acquired weapons in Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee, I expect there to be some hiccups in playing together for the first few games, but with those two, MVP frontrunner Jokic, Murray, MPJ, along with the rest of the supporting cast, the talent on the Denver side of the ball far outweighs that of Atlanta. Both teams are coming off of wins, but it feels like Denver has something to prove and will use this as a statement game. I also dislike Trae Young and his stupid lollipop that fell on the floor ass hair for no real reason. He's gonna have a rough game shooting and Lou Williams is unfortunately going to look like a shell of his former self in the first game of his second stint with his hometown team.

I don't think I've ever won a POTD when I'm among the top 2 or 3 upvoted comments. Clearly I can't handle the pressure. Both SYSTEM plays failed Saturday night to the delight of those who don't like me calling it a system. The block button was in heavy use as some bettors clearly can't handle losing. Me? I just move on to the next day. 

For Sunday, don't worry, there are no system plays. But if you're tailing me, you're rooting for misses again. Orlando travels to LA to face the Lakers. With LeBron and AD hurt, and with all of Orlandos good players dealt elsewhere, there's a severe dearth of talent on the court. 

The Lakers go under more than any team in the league at 65.2%. With one day of rest, the Lakers rank 1st (71%) and Orlando 3rd (63%) for going under. With equal rest, the Lakers are 2nd (65%) and the Magic 4th (61%).

While it may not be the case in your situation, the vast majority of times this question is asked it can be explained by:

- It's been more than 90 days since your last deposit, or
- You're asking to withdraw an amount greater than your initial deposit

In either of those cases, they can't credit back to your card. If it's not either of those cases I don't have a good answer for you and would encourage you to reach out to support for help.

Also worth pointing out that your original post says:

&gt;&gt;check(which is $15...

Which reads as if there's a $15 fee to receive funds by check. This is not the case the policy is that a withdrawal by check must be for a *minimum* of $15, not a fee of $15. Withdrawal by check should not come with a fee. If your withdrawal is over $2,000 it'll be FedExed priority and you should see it in 1-3 days.

814,14,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;Why won't it just let me get it back into my bank card? 

Have you previously had any withdrawals credited to your original card?

The policy is pretty straightforward and can be found on their website. I'm not going to go looking for it now, but unless things have changed it's something along the lines of:

Funds, up to the original deposit amount, will be credited to the payment method used for the initial deposit, provided a deposit has been made in the last 90 days. Any excess funds (i.e. more than your original deposit) will be delivered via check or paypal.

Two obvious possibilities:

1. You've already, at some point, had the original deposit amount credited back to your bank card. Or,

2. It's been over 90 days since you've made a deposit, in which case you're limited to paypal/check.

If you're asking for anything greater than a ""refundable"" deposit then the policy clearly limits you to check/paypal - always has.",,1613749049,georgethethirteenth,anyone_else_have_any_problems_withdrawing_their

Crazy play, but not inexplicable. He was 0.23% owned in the DK Big Jam that night - he was only in 2 of the top 12 and he was in the winning lineup, which was Moklovin who had 150 in that contest and probably maxed out nearly every contest that night. So it was inevitable that he'd have Lonnie rostered in a few.

He was close to min salaried (3100), was coming off a game in which he put up good points in garbage time, and had historically defended Harden well so could be expected to see more minutes than average (I don't know this off the top of my head, went back to the preslate thread for 12/3/19 on another message board where he was mentioned as an absolute bottom barrel punt play), so while not a good play he might not have been unreasonable. He happened to have a near ceiling game that went to double OT - almost inevitable that he'd be in winning lineup in that situation.

In hindsight its an absolutely reasonable play that you'd expect to see from someone who played hundreds of lineups that night.

In wondering when this was, I can't find a night where Lonnie Walker was in a high finishing lineup since the new year. 

I know it's a different sport, but I'd this just like there was no reason to play Chase Claypool in Week 5? Because everyone bitched about that but it was easy to find talk of people giving him 3-5% shares. Just like there was no reason play Mariota in the Week 15 Sunday night showdown? Because everyone bitched about that, but if you download the csv after kickoff of any showdown you'll see that mass entrants will nearly always put in a lineup or two with a backup qb, it's a guaranteed high cash on the 1% chance a starter goes down. 

The point is, when you're mass entering at high volumes (and not necessarily in the same contests) there's reason to play nearly everyone at some level.

1059,19,dfsports,"Maybe this just worked last night with so many inactive and starting lineup calls made in the late games slot. But one piece of advice I was given last night was to air on the side of rostering more late game plays, because it will give you more lineup flexibility to make changes when lineups and inactives are announced. This can let you get smash plays (like Lou Will after Kawaii was ruled out) at low ownership, since other lineups are too locked in by then. If Kawaii was inactive before slate top off I bet Lou Will would’ve hit 50% ownership, but instead you got him for under 10%.

Of course this doesn’t work every night, and last night happened to have a lot of interesting late slot question marks that could have created value (Deaaron Fox and Bagley, all those Magic inactives, then getting lucky with Kawaii ruled out late). But anyways something I’m going to try more of after having my first big win of the season in a lineup where I made like 6 late swaps to Lou Will, Terrence Ross, MCW, etc. Again I probably got lucky, but am going to try it again, as it seems like there’s always question marks and late in active calls, especially with more teams giving rest days.",,1613406621,pmayankees,how_do_they_do_it

1082,42,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;DraftKings once said line up trains are not allowed. I don’t know where they stand today on this issues

Their ToS disallow collaboration, sharing, or buying/selling of lineups. The question is, how do you enforce something like that? 

You say that 5 years ago you'd never seen the same lineup in a 50/50 but now you'll see 25% duplicates. You're right. And there are two issues.

1. Players who think that if they simply pay their subscription fee to Rotogrinders/Awesemo/Rotowire/whomever and just play the ""optimal"" they'll come out ahead over the course of the season. Maybe they're right, I don't know I haven't tested it. Sucks for those of us who do our own work and get stuck behind these trains, but the more people that buy onto them the lower their EV. It'll never stop though, even if this is a losing strategy there are enough fish out there looking for a quick payday that for everyone who drops out of this train there's another to replace them.

2. I've said it before, but DFS isn't a sports game, it's a data analytics game. Eventually the analytics become good enough to beat the game and I think we're there with the NBA. You're not going to win NBA DFS as a basketball fan, that's just the way it is. There's too much information out there and it's gotten to the point that it's good enough that DFS quite simply isn't a ""game"" anymore. Take away everything I said in the first point and force everyone to hand build their lineups on their own. The sharks are still going to be duplicating each other and if you're not duplicating them? Sorry, but you're the fish.

Unfortunately, I don't think the second point is fixable. There's an information glut and that information is too good, you can't put that back in the bag (and it's not something that could ever have been stopped given time). 

I'm not even sure the first one can be addressed with any teeth. As long as the information exists, someone is going to sell it. Especially as it's more readily available, the more people that have it the lower the edge gets for those who have ""solved"" the game. As that edge approaches nil, those that have ""solved"" it out are certainly smart enough to figure out that there's more profit in selling to the fish than trying to beat the other sharks.

There are other sports that haven't gotten to this point, but the NBA is dead (yet I still play, haha). At least in terms of cash games.

There are still some ways to avoid the trains. Snake draft is a solution that is fun (I think anyways) and has zero chance of duped lineups. There's an element of luck (draft position) which I think can even things up at least a little bit against the sharks. Though this is a format that needs improvement as well.

The short of it is, I don't think you're wrong in your sentiment. On the other hand, I don't think DF or FD *could* fix this even if they wanted to.

To repeat myself, DFS *isn't a sports game*, it's a data analytics game. Eventually those with the tools, the smarts, and the means are going to figure it out - and they have.",,1613401067,georgethethirteenth,whats_up_with_so_many_nba_dfs_players_having_the

It might give you a line up where Harden is PG or UTL. The optimizer I'm looking for is one that you can lock certain players to certain slots.

Or even better, if we can download the CVS file from the contest after it started.

Is this split between prep and college players? 

One of my favorites was Evan Longoria, but he came ready made to dominate. But he's also older so his ceiling, in theory, should be somewhat capped.

For prep/amateurs, I can think of Trout and Acuña. They're definitely guys that would drive the numbers up for the really young guys.

I think the baseball rainout is a bad example though - weather reports are freely available and are something we should be taking into account when formulating our baseball lineups. 

Despite that, shit happens after lock sometime and unfortunately bad luck is part of the game sometimes. I'm honestly not sure how the Herro situation is all that different from, for example, a hockey goalie who's announced as the starter but takes a puck to the neck during warmups and can't play, do we expect a refund then?

Only tangentially related, but pet-peeve of mine, whenever something like this happens there is sure to be a barrage of comments on message boards and Twitter to the tune of ""five minute before tip-off? NBA has to do better"". Why? DFS might be a nice revenue stream for these leagues, but it's far from being a primary money source. *They don't play the games for the benefit of DFS players* and I honestly don't think fantasy, gambling, or DFS should receive one iota of consideration in terms of what/when news and information about these games comes out. My primary sport is hockey and earlier this situation Pete DeBoer said he wouldn't be announcing starting goaltenders, if you want to know who's starting tune in when they take the ice. Super aggravating from a DFS perspective, makes Vegas goaltenders near unplayable but in no way, shape, or form should he be thinking about me when it comes to his lineup. If he thinks there's a competitive advantage to be gained from not announcing his starter more power to him.

I wrote about NBA DFS strategy, including some of the advanced statistic you can look towards. In my newsletter yesterday, check it out if you want! 

I think for GPPs potential is a big one, can that player have a huge game? For example, Rudy Gay might be a great cash play but he wouldn’t be a GPP guy as he’s not likely to be in an optimal lineup. 

I like looking towards salary adjusted DvP (a lot more predictive then regular DvP) and also player profile DvP. (All of this is in our newsletter btw)

1326,46,dfsports,"1. Expected minutes: this is the most critical element to nba dfs imo. Whether you’re trying to find value plays or your top pay up option, having and understanding of the minutes someone will play is critical. This season especially with so many players missing games there’s a ton of value to be found when a team is only running 8-9 guys for a game. With the spend up options it factors more into game script - a guy like giannis isn’t going to pay off his price if the game blows out. Knowing whose injured each slate and determine where those minutes will be allocated is crucial. 

2. Matchup and pace: I’ve been targeting teams playing the nets, bulls, wizards and timberwolves all year. Teams that play at a faster pace and have higher scoring games are going to result in more fantasy points. Knowing teams that have exploitable matchups will be huge in finding smash plays (big men against Minnesota w/o KAT, nets for example). 

3: Correlation: this comes most into play for me when I’m picking my spend-up options. If I’m playing a superstar at a 10k+ price point I’m going to be hoping the game stays close so that they finish out the game and get big 4th quarter minutes. In order for this to happen, a player or players on the other team are going to need to have good nights so I’ll look to play the opponent as well. 

4: Fantasy points per minute: this is a bit of a redundant point since I’ve already gone over minutes, but for value plays especially it’s important to know what guys are good ppm players relative to others. Gary Clark or pj tucker might be in line for huge minutes thanks to injuries or Covid but if they’re only getting half a point a minute it’s not going to pay off. But if someone like Boucher, Cousins, or Whiteside is in line for more minutes you can feel confident that they’re in a good spot to smash because they’re so productive fantasy wise. 

5: Ownership: this is an extremely important piece as well. If you’re playing tournaments, you almost have to find low owned players that go off in order to achieve a good placement. Guys who are coming off injury (porzingis, valanciunas recent examples), in shooting slumps, or maybe a bit overpriced are good places to look. In cash, knowing the chalk is also very important. In basketball especially players are usually chalk for a reason, and it generally makes less sense to fade them in cash. Make calculated decisions as to whether or not to play the chalk and avoid the hero plays in cash. 

Putting it all together: 

Here’s the gpp lineup I ran last night that cashed in the second-to-min tier. 

Curry, Ross, Oubre, Draymond, Vucevic, Maxey, Olynyk, Derrick Jones Jr. 

I chose to stack the magic warriors game because both these teams had a lot of injuries that opened up value, but ultimately missed on my fill-in guys. Maxey seemed high-upside without Milton and I expected Derrick Jones to play bigger minutes than he did. Still cashed because my stack paid off and the lineup was so highly correlated, but a little higher owned than I would’ve liked.",,1613157706,NotALamp123,how_do_yall_make_your_line_ups_in_terms_of_what

1330,50,dfsports,"&gt; Lesson: Check back before first tip off.
&gt; 
&gt; 

This, to me, is actually one of the most important pieces of advice that a new player needs to hear, especially if you're playing NBA. 

Are you free to be in front of your phone/computer five minutes before the tip of each game in the slate? If the answer to that question is ""no"" then DON'T PLAY. You will end up with goose-eggs in your lineup and you'll be at a strong disadvantage against the majority of players who *are* checking in multiple times a night - even at the lowest of stakes players are checking and re-optimizing their lineups multiple times a night.

Biggest piece of advice is to pay attention throughout the day and close to lock for each game. Know that you're putting out a lineup that is going to be active and don't fall victim to a failed COVID test or ""load management"" decision made 20 minutes before tip.

...and as Herro taught us last night and Roby the night before, even being 100% on top of things doesn't always guarantee a last minute scratch leading to a dead lineup.",,1613154973,georgethethirteenth,how_do_yall_make_your_line_ups_in_terms_of_what

For me, I tend to look at minutes, points per game, history, match up and opportunity for that player. I also use projections on various sites (RotoGrinders, Awesomo, etc.) and see if my own personal projections match theirs. One thing I learned early on was that if you consider a player a massive value, then everyone else does too and they tend to be the highest owned players on the slate which is great for cash games, but not great for tournaments. As far optimizer's go, they're only as good as the work you put into, so if you pay for one, pick 2 players and have it spit out 150 lineups, then you're probably not going to do very well. You have to do your research on the front end before you understand how to work them. Like I said, it's a grind, but once you find your mojo, you're off to the races. I'm still so new to it all and definitely not cashing every single night, but I'm learning more and more as I play and know the big takedown is coming soon.

1333,53,dfsports,"I’ve been playing for almost 10 years now and have about a half dozen single entry wins over multiple sports the last few years.  While I do not have any huge wins (I don’t play multi entry tournaments 99.9% of the time any more) I’ve been profitable for at least the last 3 years.  It takes A LOT of practice and good game selection to be good at DFS.

Basketball, despite being my favorite sport generally, is my worst DFS sport.  I do best at baseball, MMA and NFL (in that order) and have recently started playing NHL despite not watching hockey at all.  I did this because the rule set in NHL is similar to that of baseball.

But anyway, here are a few tips.  Please remember that I play almost exclusively single entry tournaments.

- Read the rules: this might sound silly, but really, take 5 minutes and read the actual rules.  Some sports like baseball, hockey or football have one scoring play that is worth multiple times more than everything else.  In those cases it’s the homerun, goal or touchdown.  I lean heavily into people who do these things regularly.  The draw back is a feast or famine approach that will leave me out of the money more often than I would like, but the upside is that one good night will pay for your whole season.  I win a baseball tournament once because I had 6 guys hit homers.  I won a football tournament once because I had 7 guys from the same game and it ended up like 45-42.  Don’t be afraid to throw all your eggs in one basket.  

- all things being equal choose your least expensive players first.  You don’t want to start out going “tonight I’m using Patrick Mahomes no matter what” and then you need to backfill your roster with sub optimal plays to fit that initial thought.  If you choose the least expensive player you would be willing to use first then you’ll know exactly how much room you’ll need to fit in a star.

- download every lineup update app you can find.  When baseball season comes you’ll be happy you did when a pop up rain shower is scheduled to roll in 37 minutes after first pitch.

- forget what happened yesterday.  Just because a player was good yesterday doesn’t mean he will be good today.  Also, just because he was good yesterday doesn’t mean he won’t be good again today.  Every slate is a new game.  Treat it as such.

- in specific sports this is what I look for most ...

MMA: the ability to end fights quickly
NFL: the ability to score TDs
NBA: hell if I know that shit’s impossible 
NHL: the ability to score goals
MLB: the ability to hit homeruns

Hope this helps.  At the end of the day there is no magic sauce so just read the rules and do your best to maximize what those rules allow you to do.",,1613154449,thedkexperience,how_do_yall_make_your_line_ups_in_terms_of_what

1336,56,dfsports,"If you don't mind hearing from someone that at best doubles in a GPP and in most cases misses the money, I research what people post in this thread and the articles linked herein.  So, not sure who also using those is winning big, but it ins't me.  There are a few things I'm really good at doing.  I'm really good at picking healthy players on days I make sure to check before first tip off, but also really good at finding someone that somehow doesn't play on days I forget to check back before first tip off.  Lesson:  Check back before first tip off.

I also pretty much only play single entry, low entry fee GPPs on FD.  Strategies I look to use, which I don't know whether they work include maybe staying away from high costs all stars on the back of a back to back if they had high minutes the day before.  I just feel their ceiling game is less likely, and that's a high cost to have to get 5-6x, which is usually like 45-65 fps.  I'll look for value plays of guys that may be filling in for a resting starter, but more times that not, there are a few of these guys any given slate, and thus far I've either missed the right one, or the right one is chalk and I hit it.  

And finally, probably my worst strategy, is to for some reason be attracted to guys with the orange envelope next to their name, meaning some recent news.  If I click those dudes and their recent points seem way too high for their price, I choose them, and they usually suck.

So, maybe this is a lesson in what not to do.  

Summary:  Don't play the guys the websites say to play.  Don't play guys with orange envelopes next to their name.  And don't play guys that are filling in for resting starters that seem like a good value.  Your best bet is to nail the studs so they produce 7x, and then pick a few random dudes that absolutely go off for no reason other than people that play a ton of line ups have them, and get lucky.

When it comes to Football you probably do what I do and way over think it and really read into matchups and projections, just to see Cole Beasley have a huge game while Diggs watches. Or read how recent years Derrick Henry was terrible against the Ravens in game 1 but always tore them up in game 2 just to watch the 'king' run for 40 yards on 18 attempts. Thanks bud, solid loss of $20.

But really, I think it's because you way over think like a lot of us do. You don't read way into the matchups because, frankly, you probably have no idea if the matchup is any good so you you play the player instead.

I know yesterday was only a two game slate, but that same $4 GPP you're talking about was split in half. Yeah, they put out two $4 GPPs with $8K prize pools instead of the one with a $25K prize pool. I know a larger contest for a two game slate is going to be prone to big chops, but there was little incentive to play yesterday if you're a GPP person.

They'll tell you that NHL doesn't get the engagement of other sports and that sizes and prize pools are determined through a fancy machine learning algorithm that helps them find the sweet spot to make all their players happy, but this has been a repeated complaint among NHL players going on three seasons now.

For those who like to MME but aren't down to spend $1,500 a night they *finally* threw out a couple $0.25/150 max contests with decent prize pools for the Monday night slate. Both of which filled quickly enough that a third smaller one was added before lock, showing that the demand is there, but sadly they haven't been seen since.

I generally stay away from GPPs, but hockey is the one sport where I will play across the board and on nearly every slate offered in a particular night (classic/showdown/tiers). Unfortunately, hockey offerings have always been poor.

Despite repeated assurances from DK that offerings will improve when/if player engagement increases I've actually learned that if a decent contest pops up I'd be well-served to reserve a seat immediately. If I wanted to play in the NBA Fadeaway tonight, or any other night (I don't, but just for an example), I know I'm pretty safe to wait until I get off work to throw my lineups in, but if I see something attractive for hockey I know that I need to reserve my spots early because if I wait until I get home at 5:30 that contest will be gone.",,1613071493,georgethethirteenth,nhl_contests_stink

Not like you can't win, it just decreases your odds significantly.",,1613063846,punkfiend443,how_many_lineups_do_you_play

Do you not think that these companies have their financial records audited on the regular (they do)?

If they're entering bots into their contests, why do we get overlay - occasionally significant overlay - when they can just use those bots to fill the contest?

Back in September there was a whole debacle in which DK awarded far more $20 Best Ball Millionaire tickets than there were contests available.

It very well could be that this policy was only in place for this particular contest and doesn't necessarily apply to all tickets, but I'd definitely contact customer service rather just waiting and assuming a refund will take place - just in case.

Chasing that big week 4 win was my downfall. Learned a lot from this reddit forum. Thanks everyone!,,1612891373,NationalsPride,nfl_season_recap
1597,77,dfsports,"Wow! Thanks for all the feedback! I'll do my best to answer all these.

1. The optimizer you use in the attached datasheet was created using Excel solver. That felt like a simple and accessible way to provide it to other users. As for our projections, there are (literally) hundreds of thousands of data points that go into them. We create our baseline points projections by projecting player minutes and multiplying that by player points per minute historically. (Generally PPM is calculated from the past 15 days, but there are certain cases where if say, Durant is out, and the sample size is big enough, we look at his teammates points per minute in the past when Durant has been out, obviously, sample size oftentimes becomes an issue there).

From our baseline points projection we make adjustments based on dozens of matchup and recency based factors, if I had to pinpoint the main 5 they would be player profile defense vs position (see [here](https://analyticcity.com/pages/player-profiles-an-advanced-analytical-approach-to-dfs-matchups)), salary adjusted DvP (especially if sample size for player profile is too small), O/U, TM Usage out, POS Usage/Min's out, etc.

2) Currently, I have been collecting data from this season for which I can backtest my adjustments against, seeing if adjustments I make reduces the error created from our projections and the actual player points. I would love to test this against last season as well, but I have had a hard time finding the full sets of data I need, and going back to every single day manually seems infeasible. As for informal evaluation metrics, the optimal lineup generated by our model has outperformed the min cash line in 50-50 contests it has entered 57% of nights on DraftKings and 59% on Fanduel!

3) Currently there are two of us! I am the ""data guy"", so I handle all the spreadsheets, graphics, data analysis, and the other one of us writes the blogs you will find on our homepage!

4) I think as of now I am going to hold off on making our work open source, but it is definitely something I will consider down the road.

I hope that answered your questions somewhat succinctly, I could go on for pages about our specific projection methods lol.",,1612891280,Analytic_City,completely_free_lineup_optimizer_ownership

1599,79,dfsports,"This is fantastic, thank you so much! Kudos!

A few questions, if you don't mind:

1. As someone with a little bit of Machine Learning and Optimization background, do you care to elaborate on any of the technical details about how your projections and optimizers work, at a high level?
2. Is there any mechanism to give feedback on how these lineups do in contests? Either formally to improve your optimizers performance in the future, or informally just to let other users know how much success people have had with it?
3. How big is the team at Analycity? Looks like more than 1 person could take on, but if so, all the more impressive!
4. In the spirit of a free product for the community, have you considered making the source code open source for others to try and play with and/or improve upon?",,1612889923,pmayankees,completely_free_lineup_optimizer_ownership

Last 3 picks:

Pelicans -6 (1u) W

Nuggets ML (1u) L

76ers -4.5 (1u) W

**Pick: USC -2 (1.5u)** vs Oregon 3/28/21 9:45 PM ET


Sport: NCAAM


Reasoning: Took a little break from posting and ofc I go 3-0 during that time lmfao. Alright, easy dub here with USC. Oregon when they make 8+ 3s are 15-1 on the season, that's great. Oregon goes crazy from the 3, making 47.6% but USC isn't too far behind, as they shoot 47.1%. The main thing to watch is the pace, Oregon LOVES scoring in transition but USC is an absolute beast on the boards. Oregon was BUILT to play Iowa, especially with Iowa's best player being Garza, who is a beast but slow as molasses. 

I personally think USC is Oregon's kryptonite and their last time playing each other a bit more than a month ago (when USC won by 14 points) is indicative of how this game will go. A week off means that momentum doesn't really factor in as much and true talent/matchup shines.

533,53,sportsbook,"**Record: 6-1-0 (+6.02U)**

**Last Pick:** St Kilda Saints 1-39 (Margin) @ 2.50 **L** \- Tough first loss, as we looked good to begin but lost any competitiveness on the verge of half time.

**Todays Match**: Fremantle Dockers v Greater Western Sydney Giants - **AFL**\- 5:40pm ACDT (6 hours til start)

**Pick: Greater Western Sydney Giants 1-39 (Margin) @ 2.50**

**\*For People who cant find this pick, either take Giants ML or on the line (this will be lower odds but essentially same pick)\***

\*also to clarify, 1-39 means the Giants to win the game between 1 and 39 points\*

**Reasoning:** Both teams suffered defeats last week, however at stages both teams looked solid. Any game in Perth isnt easy, however with Fremantle having a few outs due to injury i think this helps a slightly stronger giants team. This game should be a relatively low scoring game, whereby Giants will find it slightly easier to come by goals in which will give them a 2-3 goal edge at the end of the game. Expect both teams to put up a valiant effort but a stronger bounce back game from Giants is needed here, to have any hopes of challenging for a finals spot.

810,10,dfsports,"Ah I think the issue is maybe DK vs FanDuel. With DK multi position eligibility and utility type positions,  ownership can look totally different.

858,58,dfsports,"I play on Fanduel so the scoring is different, but so far:

I like Ricky Simon because he is a takedown machine and Kelleher struggles against upper level fighters.  

Rodolfo Viera is an undefeated BJJ ace with all of his wins coming via stoppage and he is facing a young inexperienced fighter.  

I wouldn't feel comfortable with Gastelum based on his last 2 performances, even though he is clearly the superior fighter to Heinisch

I actually like both Barber and Jimmie Rivera in contrast to Grasso and Munhoz, but both of those fights could go either way.  

Julian Marquez could be worth a shot in a few lineups, as Pitolo has looked terrible against any stiff competition that he has faced.  I hate MMA math but Marquez also put Phil Hawes to sleep who is a legitimate top prospect in the MW division.

I also believe Gilbert Burns is worth a play in a few lineups as he poses a serious threat to Usman on the feet and especially on the ground with his BJJ skills.  I don't feel comfortable rostering Usman because even though he is extremely talented, and rightfully so a big favorite, his style does not score many points as he often does nothing with his takedowns and just stalls and holds his opponents against the cage.  I expect his salary to be way to high for his style of fighting.",,1612827838,TheRealJoeLunardi,mma_213_dk_lineup_help

so I invite you to witness the birth of a new subreddit by a degenerate, currently 16 hours old

www.reddit.com/r/gamblingstocks

Not my original dd or write up, i converted and launched the new subreddit here hours ago!

initial dd link here: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld8dsi/score_media_and_why_its_a_massive_candidate_for_a/

Score Media and Gaming, listed on the TSX as SCR and in the US as TSCRF.

These guys have nothing but positive news coming in the next 12 months and has the ability to at least double in the next half year, if not sooner. These guys are foraying into the sports betting market and are the only players that have a fully intuitive and integrated sports scores/stats application on the market.

So what are the positives/catalysts for Score Media:

Expansion with the help/investment of Penn Gaming to expand sportsbook in the US. Keep in mind, Penn is the same company that invested in Barstool. The Score is already approved in New Jersey, Indiana and Colorado, with Iowa right around the corner, and Michigan up next.

Sports betting in Canada is a 14 Billion dollar market. Single wagering is currently illegal, however, there is unity across the aisle between all political parties to amend the criminal code and make single wagering legal. There are currently two bills in play. C-13 and C-218. C-13 second reading is currently delayed, while C-218 is scheduled for the House of Commons on February 24th. Like most countries, they have currently spent a ton of money propping up their respective economies due to COVID-19. It is highly unlikely the Canadian government rejects this massive taxable revenue stream when it needs it the most

Leader in sports applications for time spent on the app on a monthly basis, beating out heavy hitters like TSN, ESPN, Bleacher Report....literally every other sports media application

Only major player with an already existing sports news/fantasy application with seamless sportsbook integration. No hopping back and forth, you can wager through the sports app as if you were on the sportsbook

They are the biggest E-sports media player with over 1 million subscribers on YouTube and that lead is growing

They are pushing to get listed on the NYSE in the very near future to further growth and investment opportunities.

The only real hinderance that could potentially stop the run of this company is if the Canadian government fails to amend the current laws for single game wagering, which in the current economical climate, I find extremely unlikely. ESPECIALLY with support from all political parties including the Conservatives, New Democratic Party, Bloc Quebecois and most Liberal MP's.

Even in the event that this for some reason failed to pass, it still has access to an enormous US market with the backing of Penn.

I love this stock boys and girls!

Curious that you don't have a goaltender in either of your example lineups as it's rare for an optimal Showdown lineup to not contain one.

I can see the argument for not wanting to use one in the early game tonight (in fact, I won't be...Greiss could easily end up in the single digits or negative and I'm concerned Vasilevskiy won't see the volume needed to make value without a shutout), but I can't imagine the late game contests will see a winning lineup without one of the goaltenders.

Completely agree that both Cade and Mamu are must plays. 

Carlik Jones would’ve been a great play but rip to that game. 

My value pick is also a stretch, but it’s PJ Fuller for TCU. Neither team is great defensively, and Fuller is a very cheap player ( 3,600) for hopefully 30 minutes of PT. He’s priced so low because he doesn’t have much output, but I needed to find a reaching value player and feel good about his value, his floor, and potential ceiling.",,1612366096,LUFDA47,college_hoops_picks_23

I do not use Awesemo Projections as I just did not like it, but I use fantasy cruncher for all of my lineups. The difference is that I have my own algorithm for my projections of each player (I am a Computer Science Major).

If you want to get really good, having the best projection model possible is key. You mostly want projections based on statistics and algorithms, but sometimes manually adjusting your projections based on speculation of what you think a player's projections will be is key too.

Awesemo has the best ownership projections by far and there are no best fantasy points projections from websites in my opinion. The best projections are made by yourself. The best optimizers are Fantasy Labs / Fantasy Cruncher.

I use my custom made projections and upload them into the Fantasy Cruncher Optimizerto come up with my lineups. I pay close attention to all of the new regarding injuries, starting lineups, game postponement, load management, etc.

1057,17,dfsports,"You make some valid points, I still think Ayo is one of the best plays on the slate. Bottom line is he is too cheap and I’m not too worried about matchup if he’s playing anyone other than Baylor. Watts could be a potential value play, but he’s too risky for my liking. His minutes aren’t guaranteed and he’s been playing terrible since the start of the season. Micah potters minutes dipped pretty significantly in the last game which makes me kind of skeptical. Aleem Ford is basically the same price and he played 32 minutes in the last game. Of course potter could go off on any given slate, and I’m very aware Everyone’s minutes on Wisconsin are very erratic. So it could be potter that gets the boost in minutes and Ford gets the dip, even though Ford played great last game. But I agree at least that Murray’s recent uptick in minutes is very promising. But ultimately, you really don’t have to play Ayo; there are plenty of other guys to at up for. In my opinion, Ayo is the best price adjusted play, and I’m gonna stick to that. Even if he duds and scores like 25. But I really doubt he will. Thanks for the feedback! Even if I don’t 100% agree, I appreciate any feedback and anyone challenging my picks and giving alternative plays.",,1612300238,punkfiend443,college_hoops_picks_22
1058,18,dfsports,"I don’t love the Ayo play tbh. Indiana’s defense has looked surprisingly great the bad few games, and I’d rather spend that high cash elsewhere. 

With so many BIG games today, I feel like there’s so many big men to try and play at the same time, therefore I’ll provide some additional value players.

Rocket watts returned as the starting PG. This MSU team might get blown out by 40, but they will still manage to score 60. For 4,100, and hopefully 30 minutes of PT. I like this play for a pretty bad Iowa defense. 

Micah Potter, pretty cheap and great value. I don’t actually know the stats on PSU’s defense, but I can’t imagine harrar guarding Potter effectively. Obviously potter’s last game was filled with foul trouble and an overall awful performance. But Wisconsin at home against PSU? I’ll take that risk. 

Also love the ke Murray play. Not only has he looked great all season, but Fran finally rewarded him with 32 minutes last game. Maybe Fran finally has released he needs more length on defense, or that nunge is just an average player, but Murray seems like a solid play.",,1612299606,LUFDA47,college_hoops_picks_22

1119,79,dfsports,"To your point the second paragraph is exactly why basketball is both pro friendly and much harder than it looks.  I love he NBA and follow it closely, but at the end of the day I’m not as good as an algorithm in predicting minutes and usage.

In baseball everyone plays 9 innings unless they are in a platoon which you would know about pre game.  No pro advantage there.  Meanwhile barring an injury you’re not going to have James Harden or LeBron get a zero.  They might under perform for 35 but that’s not even remotely the same as a goose egg.  A pro can do all the research in the world and get a zero from their best player.

So yes, embrace the variance!  People don’t like baseball because they “don’t know what to expect” which is exactly why they should.  Because the pros don’t know what to expect either.

You’re absolutely going to have bad days in baseball.  Don’t over commit to any one slate.  But in each short slate play to win.  Stack that game from Middle America when everyone is on the Yankees and Red Sox.  Play a bunch of A’s when everyone is playing Dodgers.

I explained what sports and what stakes in the post. I had a 70% hit-rate in DOUBLE UPS, throughout ALL sports that I provide. This means NBA, NFL, MMA, PGA, MLB, LOL, CBB, and CFB.

I try my best to get lineups sent out an hour before lock to make sure that people have time to get it in, but I do not quit working on the lineup until lock. I do hours of research every day and try my best on every slate, because these are the lineups that I am personally using.

Just as I try and help people with bankroll management and contest entries to make sure they have the best chance possible to succeed using my lineups.

I also plan on releasing core plays for each slate, rather than just sending full lineups as we grow. Because obviously once there are so many subscribers it isn't viable to send out full lineups and have everyone sharing the money.

Thank you for the questions and feedback though, and I definitely do think that we can agree that a lot(if not MOST) lineup sellers are just in it for money and have no idea what they are doing in most cases lol.

I try and put my money where my mouth is and this is the reason I only play the lineups that I provide, and if I decide that there are some plays that I love in a slate, I make sure to tell people that they can swap certain plays if they like them better, or if I'm playing multiple lineups I let them know.",,1612219898,TestTheLimitTwitch,best_lineups_available

1199,79,dfsports,"I end up with the same lineup as Chipotle a lot. 

It's really simple for max entry; the ""good"" players pick the same or similar cores. 

Then they run it through a lineup generator with different weight settings and create a gradient that gradually shifts from one extension of the core to the other. You normally weight your ""favorite"" core into switching one or two players out to try to hit every variation of that team ""hitting."" 

Upload the CSV, and, bam, now you end up sharing a bunch of lineups with a bunch of other people who had the same cores and ran them through their generators. 

This is ESPECIALLY prevalent in Showdowns, when some games are so obvious, you are sharing lineups with like 30 other people. Every football game a week ago was like that in Showdown, and Chipotle, etc. were all sitting in and out of first with the same goofy lineup I had, just because it was so obvious. But we also had a billion other variations going too. 

What I think you are underestimating is how price value affects cores. If you have a similar core, you only have X amount of dollars to work with, and people start picking the same players to fit in that value, which lowers variations. Optimizers are going to pull a lot of the same people to fit in that value, and you have to manually switch out those people to be different. A lot of people make the same decisions in those cases.",,1612216462,arrogancygames,proof_of_collusion_or_am_i_wrong
1200,0,dfsports,"Then you need to articulate yourself better.

I see your complaint: There are numerous players with duplicate lineups and its no fun playing in a 23 entry contest when 11 of those lineups are duplicated. I get it, you're not wrong.

I see two parts to your accusation:

1. Big name players are working together. But your evidence doesn't support that. A bunch of duplicated lineups in these contests would make ZERO sense for colluding players and would reduce their expected outcome.

2. Big name players are sharing their ""data sets"". I'm still not sure what you mean by ""data set"". I posit that two highly skilled/knowledgeable players working from the set projections are highly likely to independently produce duplicate lineups. NBA is at a point where the best projections win, give everyone access to the same set of numbers they will surely choose the same players (and yes, even in the same slots in their lineup)

&gt;&gt;Why is it only these certain usernames that end up with the same lineup on slates as big as ten games even? 

**The simple answer here goes back to ""the NBA is solved"" and these players have figured it out.** Is the 'right' lineup going to win/cash every night? No, but in the long run it will outperform lesser skilled players. Again, the high bankroll  players aren't winning 100% of their contests, they're winning players because the grind out at a positive EV at high volume. 

There's a 'right' answer to NBA lineups, some people have it and many people don't.

I'm not saying collusion doesn't happen, in fact it absolutely *does*, but not typically in these contests and not typically at the price points that the majority of DFS players are playing on a regular basis.

Imagine entering a $10.6K entry 3-player contest on Fanduel, shortly after you enter Player X joins. Five minutes later Player Y enters. After awhile you notice that Players X and Y seem to join these contests within minutes of each other. More than that their lineups *never* match (contests of this size and at this price point *routinely* chop). Players X and Y are likely colluding by ensuring that their lineups *do not* match, giving them a 2/3 chance at winning the contests and splitting the proceeds. This is the kind of collusion that takes place (there are two top players on FD who are fairly well-known to do exactly this), but there's simply no way that top players are doing this at price points below $500 or so, they're not doing it in a 22 person contest, and their not intentionally matching lineups.

Seriously, look at the results of 3-5 person contests at these higher price points and see how often you see matching lineups, there would be absolutely no incentive to duplicate a lineup contests of that size.",,1612213053,georgethethirteenth,those_people_with_the_same_lineup_in_your_double

I've been a lifelong NBA fanatic, but I only do okay at DFS. My best play is usually in-game showdown contests when you can see how the flow of the game is going and kind of predict minutes for the second half.

1211,11,dfsports,Makes sense. I am definitely going to take some shots this year. I usually try to stick to single entry 1 or 2 dollar tournaments. Usually play everything on DK but I like that Fanduel only does one pitcher so might switch back over for MLB,,1612206724,Arrow_Flash626,does_anyone_have_a_good_story_about_turning_a_dfs
1212,12,dfsports,"I do stack for sure but the stacks come naturally.  Like if I thought the Phillies 2 and 4 hitters were gonna crush I might throw in Harper batting 3rd even in a bad match up.  A lot of times you get the most value out of all star hitters by throwing them in against sub par matchups.

Here is how I do it.  Please note that I specialize in single entry tournaments and ideally smaller slates.

1 - find a pitcher who is expected to win and strike people out.  There is no such thing as too expensive.  Sometimes this is a cheap player, sometimes it’s not.  On DK you need to find 2.  While I’m pro DK in every other sport I prefer FD for baseball because of one pitcher.  Anyway, get this right.  Nothing else matters if you screw this up.

2 - Usually I start by finding the lowest priced player (often an outfielder) who I believe can hit a homer.  Many days this is a bench player in a platoon.  A homer at 2500 gets as many points as one from a 5500 player.

3 - Work backwards finding the cheapest potential homer at each position.

4 - With whatever you have left upgrade to superstars.  I might not project Tatis for a homer that day but I’ll take my chances over a bench player in a spot start.

So yeah, work backwards.  Superstar hitters last.

Also, keep in mind that a homer from a Yankee at 33% owned probably costs more than one from a Royal at 2% owned.  There is a legit big market bias in DFS baseball ownership.

Edit - 3 years ago the standard baseball advice was not to stack.  Now everyone does.  In many ways stacking in baseball has jumped the shark bit.  Totally viable but probably done a bit more than it should be these days.

However ... one important note is that while you’ll never see an NBA game double the projected over under you’ll see it almost daily in baseball.  You have to find the game that goes off the rails for it to work in baseball.  A few years ago I had 6 homers from 4 to White Sox so it can work, but it worked more before 2020.",,1612206569,thedkexperience,does_anyone_have_a_good_story_about_turning_a_dfs
1213,13,dfsports,Definitely makes sense. I think I am going to try out your strategy this season with baseball and see if I can make a little bit from it. Having that homer or nothing strat is good but definitely super hard for some positions. Do you team stack or anything?

Great info, and some of the stuff you wrote i kind of already figured out, but other i thought of but wasn't sure. For sure slot WR's are definitely op. Seems like they are the highest scorers in every game or at least the most consistent and the best value. Oh, yeah and i also like to to look and make sure for let's say like Dalvin Cook, that he is also listed as the PW Back and 3rd down back in the the depth chart. Hit me up if you want to talk some strategy. What i have been doing and it gives me a good play on some deep comatose sleepers is that i will run 20 or so quick sims (with the two teams or players involved, and obv. HAVE TO be exact same roster , with the exact same depth chart and settings or else its pointless. Again, it' s real general but if i watch 20 sims between Arizona and TB and 17 out of those 20 sims Christian Kirk leads Zona in receptions and yards, a more than likely td's .  Well, i'm gonna play Kirk instead of Hopkins . The same can be said for RB's and other WR's . QB play is pretty even or sporadic depending on the match up. i'm gonna play the 11am one today hmu if you want  on here or whatever works no pressure, worries, or hurries.

1273,73,dfsports,"&gt;&gt; When 8 people have the same exact lineup in a 10 game slate it shows they are sharing their data set. 

Can you explain what you mean by ""data set""? 

Are you talking about a set of paid projections then yeah, thousands of people are sharing these every night with their paid subscriptions for RG, Awesemo, etc.?

Are you talking about a set of independently created projections? With the glut of information and analytical tools available to the public then anyone worth their salt is going to come up with similar, if not exact, lineups once they plug those into an optimizer.

As mentioned in your previous thread, the NBA game is ""solved"". Have you solved it? If not, don't get involved in cash games, you WILL lose in the long run.

One thing that doesn't get mentioned, but probably should be when this topic is brought up is that DFS *is not a sports game*. It's a data analysis game. There are thousands of people who sit on their couch and watch basketball every night, see the commercials for Draftkings, think to themselves ""I know the game backwards and forwards, easy money"", and are then shocked when they blow through $500 in a week.

We frame it as a sports game because that's what we enjoy and that what makes it fun, but let me say that again *DFS is not a sports game*. Are you good at data analysis? Recognizing trends? Turning those trends into predictions? Constantly analyzing and tweaking your prediction models? If you answered ""no"" to any one of those questions you're going to be on the losing end in the long run to people who can answer ""yes"".

The NBA is figured out (and other sports will follow, there's too much data out there), unless you have the tools that the top players have *stay away from cash*, MME tournaments and hope to win the lottery of a top prize.

Nobody is cheating you by working together (with occasional exceptions, sure), players have the same lineups because there is essentially a right answer to NBA cash no matter how big the slate is and the information to figure out that answer is readily available.",,1612186409,georgethethirteenth,those_people_with_the_same_lineup_in_your_double

Anyone with a brain is starting to realize what's going on.

People play single entry cash to avoid the other ones where people can max enter 150 lineups into a cash contest. These double ups are a lot harder.

1360,0,dfsports,"Showdowns give you the highest percentage to cash, but more often than not, you'll end up one player off even with max entries and end up not making your investment back. On a ""normal"" night, I'd make 60-70% of what I put in on a max Showdown - the only way you profit is from hitting top 10 every once in a while, which is really hard without multiple entries (and multiples lose you more money). 

It's even worse with the big GPPs with full lineups; you often end up having far less than 50% hit money and those hitting the bottom end of the bubble, making you under 50% back. And it's way harder to get top 10 due to more people playing. 

50/50s give you a much better chance to make money on a given night and to build your bankroll, if that's what you want. I personally only want the big wins at this point for the fun of it; but if you're talking profit and bankroll building, unless you're extremely lucky and hit a big jackpot early enough, 50/50 is always the way to go.",,1612107852,arrogancygames,easier_to_cash_in_gpp_then_5050_nba_dfs

1387,27,dfsports,"You need to understand that NBA DFS is effectively solved. If you subscribe to a couple good projection sources, like Awesemo and RG, open them both up and compare. There will be slim differences but the value plays will stand out, yes even on 10 game slates. Really the biggest difference in projections comes from subjective minutes allocation.

I do not think top players are blindly using popular optimizers. I do think that with them being good players, their processes will all gravitate towards the same *best* lineups. Hell, they may even be working together. If they are working together, I don’t see how that’s any worse than people just grabbing lineups from a paid source.

My best guess is that they talk to each other and discuss the best plays, and then go from there. If you play enough slates you’ll notice that they sometimes have different players.

Something I’ve never understood is why they continuously play against each other at high stakes. I feel like cash games are -EV in general at least for NBA with how solved it is, let alone playing against other top players.",,1612056053,chopkins92,proof_of_collusion_or_am_i_wrong

Why not use multiple accounts to enter 22/22? The answer *should be* obvious. One lineup is optimal. Anything above that is -EV.

I understand the frustration with paid optimizers. Sadly I do not see any way to regulate that. You can be an honest player and build your own projections, but you'll just end up with close to the same numbers anyway if you're doing it right.

Too early to make a decision on the KC backfield.

For right now I can't see myself with more than 20% exposure to the KC backs and I'm probably off CEH completely. 

I'll have one piece of the Tampa backfield in añmost all lineups and will probably combine Jones and Lenny in a few.

1489,49,dfsports,"Oh man, I think its tough to make the Succop argument here.

From a raw points perspective Williams is the obvious pick. The floors for these two guys are similar, but Williams definitely projects ahead in the median and FAR ahead when you look at ceilings.

Even from a pts/$ perspective, if I look at my own median projections I've got Williams in the 1.75-2.00 pts/$ range and Succop between 1.9-2.1 pts/$. Even with the price difference between the two you're not getting more efficient in your scoring.

As always the question is: What's that extra $1.4K allowing you to plug into your lineup and maybe that makes the difference for you. Obviously, kicker range of outcomes tend to be a bit more narrow than skill players but, for me, this doesn't look like it'll shape up to be the type of game where a kicker is going to help you all that much. I'd be shocked if Succop (or Butker) is in a winning or optimal lineup.

Obviously still too early to be making definitive statements about this game with over a week to go, but I'd be staying away from both kickers in this game.

&gt;&gt;Especially since you could argue succop is the best pick under 5k in this superbowl slate

There's an complete gift on this slate who's barely more than half the price of Succop that I'm honestly expecting a 4-5X minimum performance from and is going to hit value even at his absolute floor. I couldn't, with a straight face, say that a kicker is the best sub $5K play in this slate, but...Still more than a week to go and I'm often wrong.",,1611933407,georgethethirteenth,darrel_williams_or_ryan_succop_superbowl

More often than not a cash lineup is gonna end up a little short of the cash line for GPPs. But if you keep a core from your cash line and sub in some lower owned pivots, you have a better shot at a bigger payday. Of course its higher risk, but thats the point of playing gpps.
