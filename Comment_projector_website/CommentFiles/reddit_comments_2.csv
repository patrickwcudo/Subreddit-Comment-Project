Hey all, I've been working on a simulation model on and off for the past few years that basically uses Monte Carlo simulations to simulate games to find out the most likely outcomes. It's been on a good run recently, so I figured I'd share the results with you guys.

**FAQ:**

**What is the methodology used?**

Mainly a mix of advanced rate stats, standard deviations, positional defense, and some manual adjustments to simulate each game. It also relies heavily on the minutes projections posted by Numberfire for their daily projections.

**What exactly are you predicting?**

I run 100 simulations, and calculate the average final score from all the results. I also track what percentage of the simulations beat the spread/total, to give a little more context on how confident the simulation is in the result.

**Why should I trust you?**

You really shouldn't.

**I completely disagree with your pick, and you're a moron for making it.**

Probably.

**Yesterday's Slate (3/27/21)**

**Sunday Slate -** A friendly 4 game slate that we should be able to do a deep dive on. Apologies for the late, and limited review on Saturday, and we certainly struggled on the small unit plays (which is ok, they were low confidence), but made some back on the 2u plays. 

Night-Before Meme Parlay (&gt;+500) - Hawks ML + Suns ML + Magic ML (1u, +1206)

Initial Leans - Good luck to all! 

Suns at Hornets - **Hornets +6.5, U219.5 (1u)** \- Both teams can play defense (Hornets in lower scoring games lately, and scoring less since LaMelo went down) and this is a matinee, leading me to this under. I think the Suns are a more complete right now and should be able to win the game but Charlotte is playing well and could keep it close at home. I like the under enough to bet it right now and will revisit the game tomorrow.

Blazers at Raptors - Great revenge spot for teams that just made a relatively large trade. My initial read is the Raptors will be 1 or 2 point favorites and I like them to win comfortably tomorrow without any further information. I'd also lean on an under probably to around 225. We will see where the line opens and the injury reports. 

Hawks at Nuggets - **Hawks +4.5, U226.5** \- I think the Nuggets are going to be sluggish coming home from a road trip and may get caught off guard by the Hawks, who continue to impress me when their offense isn't just Trae Young heaving 3s, and they've been much better on defense. 

Magic at Lakers - **Magic +7, O208** \- This is an avoid/low confidence game, but the new Magic showed some life vs Portland, despite the crazy spread, and I'm not sure this Lakers team deserves this kind of number vs any NBA team. 

**Year to Date Slate Record** \- 529-472 (**+35.3u)**

**Weekly Slate Profit** \- **+2.5u**

**Weekly Overall Profit (My Bets) - +27.4u**

**Tuesday's Record (w-p-l)**: Slate 7-11 (**-.7u)** Overall Night (**+2.1u)** \- Some of those games were just garbage or injured teams facing off with what I felt were weird handicaps, so I'm glad that is over with. For what it is worth, we killed it on ncaab and the discord seems locked in on those lines, which is nice for those like me who focus nba.

I'm using machine learning to see if a machine can do a better job of making CS:GO picks than a slightly trained monkey (me).

**FAQ:**

**What is the methodology used?**

Pull a crapload of stats from HLTV, throw that into my magic machine learning model, and attempt to predict the final score.

**How do I use this data?**

Use it to confirm your biases, or fade if you think machine learning is complete BS. You're probably right either way!

**Why should I trust you?**

You really shouldn't. This is my first ML project, so I'm take that as you will. I'm mainly putting this here for my reference and anyone else who might be interested in using ML.

Today:

This is a tough day to forecast good odds on but I‚Äôm leaning toward taking VP 2-1 (+180). Fnatic will prob ban D2 and pick Train which I think will be close and Fnatic might be able to sneak in a win. But VP has been so strong and Fnatic has a shallow pool so VP should be taking this series. 

While Astralis have definitely looked vulnerable this week I think they‚Äôve stabilized well with back to back with a over liquid and VP.

24,sportsbook," NHL PICK FOR MARCH 28  


The Jets and Hurricanes gave us back to back wins ‚Äì lets continue this momentum with another underdog play today! (Sorry, I somehow missed the post yesterday on this site, but had Carolina listed as my POTD on my Twitter)  


RECORD:  
Bets won = 8  
Bets lost = 9  
Profit = +2.49 units (from RISKING 1 unit per play)  


Today's pick of the day (odds from Bet99 at 12:20 am Eastern Time):  


**NY Rangers vs Washington (-130)**  


This pick is based on ""The Snapped Winning Streak"" betting system, which goes as follows:  
Bet AGAINST a team whose winning streak of length 3+ was just snapped in their previous game. Make the bet only if the team you are betting has a money line that's better than -150 (i.e. 1.667 in decimal).  
This strategy, over many seasons, produced a 87.34-unit gain on 1045 bets (a 8.4% ROI).  


The Rangers had their winning streak snapped on Saturday against the Flyers so we‚Äôll be going with the Capitals on Sunday!  


Good luck!

Last Pick Afterthoughts: The game got out to a slow start and never fully bounced back to where it needed to be to hit the over. The ending had me hopeful that it would hit OT to push the scoring over the edge, but oh well. Arkansas really shot poorly (so props to them for pulling it off), but I was expecting a lot more scoring.

**3/28/21**

**Pick of the Day**: NCAAB ‚Äì #11 UCLA vs. **#2 ALABAMA -6.5** (-110)

Going back to a spread bet for today‚Äôs pick. Alabama looked like a legit Final Four team in their last game and we‚Äôve seen that they can muscle out a win when their shots aren‚Äôt falling and DOMINATE a win when they are. I think UCLA‚Äôs hot streak comes to an end against this tough Alabama team. The Tide has won 11 of their last 12, play great defense, and have many guys who can kill you from deep. Alabama has covered 4 of the last 5 times they were given a single-digit spread. UCLA hasn‚Äôt seen a team like Alabama in this tournament yet, so I‚Äôm big on the Crimson Tide.

Last 5 Picks:

Knicks ML (-139) W‚úÖ

Hawks ML (-143) L‚ùå

Knicks ML (-157) W‚úÖ

Suns ML (-165) W‚úÖ

Wizards ML (-137) W‚úÖ

POTD: Nuggets ML (-185)

Reason: Aside from that very ugly third quarter, the Wizards put together a very dominant game just as I predicted. For the limited minutes Beal had, he put together a very stellar performance, and Westbrook had a second consecutive game with 18 rebounds.

With the Nuggets newly acquired weapons in Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee, I expect there to be some hiccups in playing together for the first few games, but with those two, MVP frontrunner Jokic, Murray, MPJ, along with the rest of the supporting cast, the talent on the Denver side of the ball far outweighs that of Atlanta. Both teams are coming off of wins, but it feels like Denver has something to prove and will use this as a statement game. I also dislike Trae Young and his stupid lollipop that fell on the floor ass hair for no real reason. He's gonna have a rough game shooting and Lou Williams is unfortunately going to look like a shell of his former self in the first game of his second stint with his hometown team.

I don't think I've ever won a POTD when I'm among the top 2 or 3 upvoted comments. Clearly I can't handle the pressure. Both SYSTEM plays failed Saturday night to the delight of those who don't like me calling it a system. The block button was in heavy use as some bettors clearly can't handle losing. Me? I just move on to the next day. 

For Sunday, don't worry, there are no system plays. But if you're tailing me, you're rooting for misses again. Orlando travels to LA to face the Lakers. With LeBron and AD hurt, and with all of Orlandos good players dealt elsewhere, there's a severe dearth of talent on the court. 

The Lakers go under more than any team in the league at 65.2%. With one day of rest, the Lakers rank 1st (71%) and Orlando 3rd (63%) for going under. With equal rest, the Lakers are 2nd (65%) and the Magic 4th (61%).

10,dfsports,"Hence the word 'possibility'.

While it may not be the case in your situation, the vast majority of times this question is asked it can be explained by:

- It's been more than 90 days since your last deposit, or
- You're asking to withdraw an amount greater than your initial deposit

In either of those cases, they can't credit back to your card. If it's not either of those cases I don't have a good answer for you and would encourage you to reach out to support for help.

Also worth pointing out that your original post says:

&gt;&gt;check(which is $15...

Which reads as if there's a $15 fee to receive funds by check. This is not the case the policy is that a withdrawal by check must be for a *minimum* of $15, not a fee of $15. Withdrawal by check should not come with a fee. If your withdrawal is over $2,000 it'll be FedExed priority and you should see it in 1-3 days.

14,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;Why won't it just let me get it back into my bank card? 

Have you previously had any withdrawals credited to your original card?

The policy is pretty straightforward and can be found on their website. I'm not going to go looking for it now, but unless things have changed it's something along the lines of:

Funds, up to the original deposit amount, will be credited to the payment method used for the initial deposit, provided a deposit has been made in the last 90 days. Any excess funds (i.e. more than your original deposit) will be delivered via check or paypal.

Two obvious possibilities:

1. You've already, at some point, had the original deposit amount credited back to your bank card. Or,

2. It's been over 90 days since you've made a deposit, in which case you're limited to paypal/check.

If you're asking for anything greater than a ""refundable"" deposit then the policy clearly limits you to check/paypal - always has.",,1613749049,georgethethirteenth,anyone_else_have_any_problems_withdrawing_their

Yesterday I went with a lot of Maxey hoping he'd step in for Simmons, but it was really Seth Curry and Tobias Harris that saw big bumps in usage. Maxey didn't even return 5x value at $3200 as they went with a bench-by-committee approach.

Crazy play, but not inexplicable. He was 0.23% owned in the DK Big Jam that night - he was only in 2 of the top 12 and he was in the winning lineup, which was Moklovin who had 150 in that contest and probably maxed out nearly every contest that night. So it was inevitable that he'd have Lonnie rostered in a few.

He was close to min salaried (3100), was coming off a game in which he put up good points in garbage time, and had historically defended Harden well so could be expected to see more minutes than average (I don't know this off the top of my head, went back to the preslate thread for 12/3/19 on another message board where he was mentioned as an absolute bottom barrel punt play), so while not a good play he might not have been unreasonable. He happened to have a near ceiling game that went to double OT - almost inevitable that he'd be in winning lineup in that situation.

In hindsight its an absolutely reasonable play that you'd expect to see from someone who played hundreds of lineups that night.

In wondering when this was, I can't find a night where Lonnie Walker was in a high finishing lineup since the new year. 

I know it's a different sport, but I'd this just like there was no reason to play Chase Claypool in Week 5? Because everyone bitched about that but it was easy to find talk of people giving him 3-5% shares. Just like there was no reason play Mariota in the Week 15 Sunday night showdown? Because everyone bitched about that, but if you download the csv after kickoff of any showdown you'll see that mass entrants will nearly always put in a lineup or two with a backup qb, it's a guaranteed high cash on the 1% chance a starter goes down. 

The point is, when you're mass entering at high volumes (and not necessarily in the same contests) there's reason to play nearly everyone at some level.

19,dfsports,"Maybe this just worked last night with so many inactive and starting lineup calls made in the late games slot. But one piece of advice I was given last night was to air on the side of rostering more late game plays, because it will give you more lineup flexibility to make changes when lineups and inactives are announced. This can let you get smash plays (like Lou Will after Kawaii was ruled out) at low ownership, since other lineups are too locked in by then. If Kawaii was inactive before slate top off I bet Lou Will would‚Äôve hit 50% ownership, but instead you got him for under 10%.

Of course this doesn‚Äôt work every night, and last night happened to have a lot of interesting late slot question marks that could have created value (Deaaron Fox and Bagley, all those Magic inactives, then getting lucky with Kawaii ruled out late). But anyways something I‚Äôm going to try more of after having my first big win of the season in a lineup where I made like 6 late swaps to Lou Will, Terrence Ross, MCW, etc. Again I probably got lucky, but am going to try it again, as it seems like there‚Äôs always question marks and late in active calls, especially with more teams giving rest days.",,1613406621,pmayankees,how_do_they_do_it

42,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;DraftKings once said line up trains are not allowed. I don‚Äôt know where they stand today on this issues

Their ToS disallow collaboration, sharing, or buying/selling of lineups. The question is, how do you enforce something like that? 

You say that 5 years ago you'd never seen the same lineup in a 50/50 but now you'll see 25% duplicates. You're right. And there are two issues.

1. Players who think that if they simply pay their subscription fee to Rotogrinders/Awesemo/Rotowire/whomever and just play the ""optimal"" they'll come out ahead over the course of the season. Maybe they're right, I don't know I haven't tested it. Sucks for those of us who do our own work and get stuck behind these trains, but the more people that buy onto them the lower their EV. It'll never stop though, even if this is a losing strategy there are enough fish out there looking for a quick payday that for everyone who drops out of this train there's another to replace them.

2. I've said it before, but DFS isn't a sports game, it's a data analytics game. Eventually the analytics become good enough to beat the game and I think we're there with the NBA. You're not going to win NBA DFS as a basketball fan, that's just the way it is. There's too much information out there and it's gotten to the point that it's good enough that DFS quite simply isn't a ""game"" anymore. Take away everything I said in the first point and force everyone to hand build their lineups on their own. The sharks are still going to be duplicating each other and if you're not duplicating them? Sorry, but you're the fish.

Unfortunately, I don't think the second point is fixable. There's an information glut and that information is too good, you can't put that back in the bag (and it's not something that could ever have been stopped given time). 

I'm not even sure the first one can be addressed with any teeth. As long as the information exists, someone is going to sell it. Especially as it's more readily available, the more people that have it the lower the edge gets for those who have ""solved"" the game. As that edge approaches nil, those that have ""solved"" it out are certainly smart enough to figure out that there's more profit in selling to the fish than trying to beat the other sharks.

There are other sports that haven't gotten to this point, but the NBA is dead (yet I still play, haha). At least in terms of cash games.

There are still some ways to avoid the trains. Snake draft is a solution that is fun (I think anyways) and has zero chance of duped lineups. There's an element of luck (draft position) which I think can even things up at least a little bit against the sharks. Though this is a format that needs improvement as well.

The short of it is, I don't think you're wrong in your sentiment. On the other hand, I don't think DF or FD *could* fix this even if they wanted to.

To repeat myself, DFS *isn't a sports game*, it's a data analytics game. Eventually those with the tools, the smarts, and the means are going to figure it out - and they have.",,1613401067,georgethethirteenth,whats_up_with_so_many_nba_dfs_players_having_the

I think the baseball rainout is a bad example though - weather reports are freely available and are something we should be taking into account when formulating our baseball lineups. 

Despite that, shit happens after lock sometime and unfortunately bad luck is part of the game sometimes. I'm honestly not sure how the Herro situation is all that different from, for example, a hockey goalie who's announced as the starter but takes a puck to the neck during warmups and can't play, do we expect a refund then?

Only tangentially related, but pet-peeve of mine, whenever something like this happens there is sure to be a barrage of comments on message boards and Twitter to the tune of ""five minute before tip-off? NBA has to do better"". Why? DFS might be a nice revenue stream for these leagues, but it's far from being a primary money source. *They don't play the games for the benefit of DFS players* and I honestly don't think fantasy, gambling, or DFS should receive one iota of consideration in terms of what/when news and information about these games comes out. My primary sport is hockey and earlier this situation Pete DeBoer said he wouldn't be announcing starting goaltenders, if you want to know who's starting tune in when they take the ice. Super aggravating from a DFS perspective, makes Vegas goaltenders near unplayable but in no way, shape, or form should he be thinking about me when it comes to his lineup.

46,dfsports,"1. Expected minutes: this is the most critical element to nba dfs imo. Whether you‚Äôre trying to find value plays or your top pay up option, having and understanding of the minutes someone will play is critical. This season especially with so many players missing games there‚Äôs a ton of value to be found when a team is only running 8-9 guys for a game. With the spend up options it factors more into game script - a guy like giannis isn‚Äôt going to pay off his price if the game blows out. Knowing whose injured each slate and determine where those minutes will be allocated is crucial. 

2. Matchup and pace: I‚Äôve been targeting teams playing the nets, bulls, wizards and timberwolves all year. Teams that play at a faster pace and have higher scoring games are going to result in more fantasy points. Knowing teams that have exploitable matchups will be huge in finding smash plays (big men against Minnesota w/o KAT, nets for example). 

3: Correlation: this comes most into play for me when I‚Äôm picking my spend-up options. If I‚Äôm playing a superstar at a 10k+ price point I‚Äôm going to be hoping the game stays close so that they finish out the game and get big 4th quarter minutes. In order for this to happen, a player or players on the other team are going to need to have good nights so I‚Äôll look to play the opponent as well. 

4: Fantasy points per minute: this is a bit of a redundant point since I‚Äôve already gone over minutes, but for value plays especially it‚Äôs important to know what guys are good ppm players relative to others. Gary Clark or pj tucker might be in line for huge minutes thanks to injuries or Covid but if they‚Äôre only getting half a point a minute it‚Äôs not going to pay off. But if someone like Boucher, Cousins, or Whiteside is in line for more minutes you can feel confident that they‚Äôre in a good spot to smash because they‚Äôre so productive fantasy wise. 

5: Ownership: this is an extremely important piece as well. If you‚Äôre playing tournaments, you almost have to find low owned players that go off in order to achieve a good placement. Guys who are coming off injury (porzingis, valanciunas recent examples), in shooting slumps, or maybe a bit overpriced are good places to look. In cash, knowing the chalk is also very important. In basketball especially players are usually chalk for a reason, and it generally makes less sense to fade them in cash. Make calculated decisions as to whether or not to play the chalk and avoid the hero plays in cash. 

Putting it all together: 

Here‚Äôs the gpp lineup I ran last night that cashed in the second-to-min tier. 

Curry, Ross, Oubre, Draymond, Vucevic, Maxey, Olynyk, Derrick Jones Jr. 

I chose to stack the magic warriors game because both these teams had a lot of injuries that opened up value, but ultimately missed on my fill-in guys. Maxey seemed high-upside without Milton and I expected Derrick Jones to play bigger minutes than he did. Still cashed because my stack paid off and the lineup was so highly correlated, but a little higher owned than I would‚Äôve liked.",,1613157706,NotALamp123,how_do_yall_make_your_line_ups_in_terms_of_what

50,dfsports,"&gt; Lesson: Check back before first tip off.
&gt; 
&gt; 

This, to me, is actually one of the most important pieces of advice that a new player needs to hear, especially if you're playing NBA. 

Are you free to be in front of your phone/computer five minutes before the tip of each game in the slate? If the answer to that question is ""no"" then DON'T PLAY. You will end up with goose-eggs in your lineup and you'll be at a strong disadvantage against the majority of players who *are* checking in multiple times a night - even at the lowest of stakes players are checking and re-optimizing their lineups multiple times a night.

Biggest piece of advice is to pay attention throughout the day and close to lock for each game. Know that you're putting out a lineup that is going to be active and don't fall victim to a failed COVID test or ""load management"" decision made 20 minutes before tip.

...and as Herro taught us last night and Roby the night before, even being 100% on top of things doesn't always guarantee a last minute scratch leading to a dead lineup.",,1613154973,georgethethirteenth,how_do_yall_make_your_line_ups_in_terms_of_what

52,dfsports,"I just started playing NBA DFS this year and absolutely love it. It's such a grind, but so much fun. I feel like anyone you ask or talk to or read about has their own system per se. For me, I tend to look at minutes, points per game, history, match up and opportunity for that player. I also use projections on various sites (RotoGrinders, Awesomo, etc.) and see if my own personal projections match theirs. One thing I learned early on was that if you consider a player a massive value, then everyone else does too and they tend to be the highest owned players on the slate which is great for cash games, but not great for tournaments. As far optimizer's go, they're only as good as the work you put into, so if you pay for one, pick 2 players and have it spit out 150 lineups, then you're probably not going to do very well. You have to do your research on the front end before you understand how to work them. Like I said, it's a grind, but once you find your mojo, you're off to the races. I'm still so new to it all and definitely not cashing every single night, but I'm learning more and more as I play and know the big takedown is coming soon.

53,dfsports,"I‚Äôve been playing for almost 10 years now and have about a half dozen single entry wins over multiple sports the last few years.  While I do not have any huge wins (I don‚Äôt play multi entry tournaments 99.9% of the time any more) I‚Äôve been profitable for at least the last 3 years.  It takes A LOT of practice and good game selection to be good at DFS.

Basketball, despite being my favorite sport generally, is my worst DFS sport.  I do best at baseball, MMA and NFL (in that order) and have recently started playing NHL despite not watching hockey at all.  I did this because the rule set in NHL is similar to that of baseball.

But anyway, here are a few tips.  Please remember that I play almost exclusively single entry tournaments.

- Read the rules: this might sound silly, but really, take 5 minutes and read the actual rules.  Some sports like baseball, hockey or football have one scoring play that is worth multiple times more than everything else.  In those cases it‚Äôs the homerun, goal or touchdown.  I lean heavily into people who do these things regularly.  The draw back is a feast or famine approach that will leave me out of the money more often than I would like, but the upside is that one good night will pay for your whole season.  I win a baseball tournament once because I had 6 guys hit homers.  I won a football tournament once because I had 7 guys from the same game and it ended up like 45-42.  Don‚Äôt be afraid to throw all your eggs in one basket.  

- all things being equal choose your least expensive players first.  You don‚Äôt want to start out going ‚Äútonight I‚Äôm using Patrick Mahomes no matter what‚Äù and then you need to backfill your roster with sub optimal plays to fit that initial thought.  If you choose the least expensive player you would be willing to use first then you‚Äôll know exactly how much room you‚Äôll need to fit in a star.

- download every lineup update app you can find.  When baseball season comes you‚Äôll be happy you did when a pop up rain shower is scheduled to roll in 37 minutes after first pitch.

- forget what happened yesterday.  Just because a player was good yesterday doesn‚Äôt mean he will be good today.  Also, just because he was good yesterday doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt be good again today.  Every slate is a new game.  Treat it as such.

- in specific sports this is what I look for most ...

MMA: the ability to end fights quickly
NFL: the ability to score TDs
NBA: hell if I know that shit‚Äôs impossible 
NHL: the ability to score goals
MLB: the ability to hit homeruns

Hope this helps.  At the end of the day there is no magic sauce so just read the rules and do your best to maximize what those rules allow you to do.",,1613154449,thedkexperience,how_do_yall_make_your_line_ups_in_terms_of_what

56,dfsports,"If you don't mind hearing from someone that at best doubles in a GPP and in most cases misses the money, I research what people post in this thread and the articles linked herein.  So, not sure who also using those is winning big, but it ins't me.  There are a few things I'm really good at doing.  I'm really good at picking healthy players on days I make sure to check before first tip off, but also really good at finding someone that somehow doesn't play on days I forget to check back before first tip off.  Lesson:  Check back before first tip off.

I also pretty much only play single entry, low entry fee GPPs on FD.  Strategies I look to use, which I don't know whether they work include maybe staying away from high costs all stars on the back of a back to back if they had high minutes the day before.  I just feel their ceiling game is less likely, and that's a high cost to have to get 5-6x, which is usually like 45-65 fps.  I'll look for value plays of guys that may be filling in for a resting starter, but more times that not, there are a few of these guys any given slate, and thus far I've either missed the right one, or the right one is chalk and I hit it.  

And finally, probably my worst strategy, is to for some reason be attracted to guys with the orange envelope next to their name, meaning some recent news.  If I click those dudes and their recent points seem way too high for their price, I choose them, and they usually suck.

So, maybe this is a lesson in what not to do.  

Summary:  Don't play the guys the websites say to play.  Don't play guys with orange envelopes next to their name.  And don't play guys that are filling in for resting starters that seem like a good value.  Your best bet is to nail the studs so they produce 7x, and then pick a few random dudes that absolutely go off for no reason other than people that play a ton of line ups have them, and get lucky.

They'll tell you that NHL doesn't get the engagement of other sports and that sizes and prize pools are determined through a fancy machine learning algorithm that helps them find the sweet spot to make all their players happy, but this has been a repeated complaint among NHL players going on three seasons now.

For those who like to MME but aren't down to spend $1,500 a night they *finally* threw out a couple $0.25/150 max contests with decent prize pools for the Monday night slate. Both of which filled quickly enough that a third smaller one was added before lock, showing that the demand is there, but sadly they haven't been seen since.

I generally stay away from GPPs, but hockey is the one sport where I will play across the board and on nearly every slate offered in a particular night (classic/showdown/tiers). Unfortunately, hockey offerings have always been poor.

Despite repeated assurances from DK that offerings will improve when/if player engagement increases I've actually learned that if a decent contest pops up I'd be well-served to reserve a seat immediately. If I wanted to play in the NBA Fadeaway tonight, or any other night (I don't, but just for an example), I know I'm pretty safe to wait until I get off work to throw my lineups in, but if I see something attractive for hockey I know that I need to reserve my spots early because if I wait until I get home at 5:30 that contest will be gone.",,1613071493,georgethethirteenth,nhl_contests_stink

22,dfsports,"&gt;&gt;Why can you not see teams outside the money?

Yeah, Fanduel could be a little more transparent about things, but DK actually couldn't make this any easier. Go to the contest page on the website, underneath the standings you'll see a link to ""Export Lineups to CSV"", now you have all the lineups from your contest whether they're in the money or not. 

This link is there as soon as a contest starts, so if you felt strongly about it you could absolutely audit the integrity of a contest from start to finish.

&gt;&gt;How come there has been numerous times where I have a unique lineup, yet there is some player with the same team as me.

So I usually play anywhere from 3-10 lineups depending on the slate. But the main thing is that doing just one lineup is a waste of time IMO.

35,dfsports,"Not challenging you, but are we certain of this?

Back in September there was a whole debacle in which DK awarded far more $20 Best Ball Millionaire tickets than there were contests available. At the time, the DK customer service response through twitter [response] (https://twitter.com/DK_Assist/status/1304086716521816069) was that the tickets were first come/first serve and that contests were subject to availability.

It very well could be that this policy was only in place for this particular contest and doesn't necessarily apply to all tickets, but I'd definitely contact customer service rather just waiting and assuming a refund will take place - just in case.

In the example above, I spent three days and countless hours trying to redeem multiple tickets to that best ball contest and after a long back and forth with customer service was only able to get a single $10 ticket for my inconvenience (half the value of the one of the multiple tickets I was trying to redeem).",,1612969036,georgethethirteenth,have_a_ticket_to_a_dk_contest_but_contest_is

77,dfsports,"Wow! Thanks for all the feedback! I'll do my best to answer all these.

1. The optimizer you use in the attached datasheet was created using Excel solver. That felt like a simple and accessible way to provide it to other users. As for our projections, there are (literally) hundreds of thousands of data points that go into them. We create our baseline points projections by projecting player minutes and multiplying that by player points per minute historically. (Generally PPM is calculated from the past 15 days, but there are certain cases where if say, Durant is out, and the sample size is big enough, we look at his teammates points per minute in the past when Durant has been out, obviously, sample size oftentimes becomes an issue there).

From our baseline points projection we make adjustments based on dozens of matchup and recency based factors, if I had to pinpoint the main 5 they would be player profile defense vs position (see [here](https://analyticcity.com/pages/player-profiles-an-advanced-analytical-approach-to-dfs-matchups)), salary adjusted DvP (especially if sample size for player profile is too small), O/U, TM Usage out, POS Usage/Min's out, etc.

2) Currently, I have been collecting data from this season for which I can backtest my adjustments against, seeing if adjustments I make reduces the error created from our projections and the actual player points. I would love to test this against last season as well, but I have had a hard time finding the full sets of data I need, and going back to every single day manually seems infeasible. As for informal evaluation metrics, the optimal lineup generated by our model has outperformed the min cash line in 50-50 contests it has entered 57% of nights on DraftKings and 59% on Fanduel!

3) Currently there are two of us! I am the ""data guy"", so I handle all the spreadsheets, graphics, data analysis, and the other one of us writes the blogs you will find on our homepage!

4) I think as of now I am going to hold off on making our work open source, but it is definitely something I will consider down the road.

I hope that answered your questions somewhat succinctly, I could go on for pages about our specific projection methods lol.",,1612891280,Analytic_City,completely_free_lineup_optimizer_ownership
78,dfsports,"Complete noob. Started somewhere in the middle of the season. Stuck to mostly cash games, starting deposit into DK was $10, ended with $83.

Had some fun, but am excited to start a FULL NFL season later this year. Biggest thing I learned is that despite all the analytics out there, I realized that paying attention to the news, injury reports, and factoring in overall knowledge of the sport COMBINED with analytics is key.",,1612890495,rainbowbunny123,nfl_season_recap
79,dfsports,"This is fantastic, thank you so much! Kudos!

A few questions, if you don't mind:

1. As someone with a little bit of Machine Learning and Optimization background, do you care to elaborate on any of the technical details about how your projections and optimizers work, at a high level?
2. Is there any mechanism to give feedback on how these lineups do in contests? Either formally to improve your optimizers performance in the future, or informally just to let other users know how much success people have had with it?
3. How big is the team at Analycity? Looks like more than 1 person could take on, but if so, all the more impressive!
4. In the spirit of a free product for the community, have you considered making the source code open source for others to try and play with and/or improve upon?",,1612889923,pmayankees,completely_free_lineup_optimizer_ownership
